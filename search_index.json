If you have any feedback, please feel free to file an issue on GitHub. Thank you! R Markdown is a powerful tool for combining analysis and reporting into the same document. Since the birth of the rmarkdown package (Allaire et al. 2025) in early 2014, R Markdown has grown substantially from a package that supports a few output formats, to an extensive and diverse ecosystem that supports the creation of books, blogs, scientific articles, websites, and even resumes. There is a wealth of guidance that has been written over the past few years, and the book R Markdown: The Definitive Guide (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018) provides a detailed reference on the built-in R Markdown output formats of the rmarkdown package, as well as several other extension packages. However, we have received comments from our readers and publisher that it would be beneficial to provide more practical and relatively short examples to show the interesting and useful usage of R Markdown, because it can be daunting to find out how to achieve a certain task from the aforementioned reference book (put another way, that book is too dry to read). As a result, this cookbook was born. Despite the existence of the official documentation, R Markdown users often seek help on Stack Overflow, a popular Q&amp;A forum. At the time of writing, there are more than 6,000 questions with the r-markdown tag. This huge number means that the use of the forum can be difficult if you do not have a specific problem to search for. Therefore, it may be hard for you to realize all possible things that you could do with R Markdown or how to do them. This book aims to draw together popular posts from Stack Overflow and other online resources (such as blog posts or tutorials) to provide up-to-date solutions for everyday queries that users commonly make. In fact, to help us make decisions on the potential topics to cover in this book, the second author of this book, Christophe, has built an R Markdown dashboard to scrape Stack Overflow daily for the most popular posts. Hopefully, our cookbook can become more useful by including recipes from these popular posts. This book is designed to provide a range of examples on how to extend the functionality of your R Markdown documents. As a cookbook, this guide is recommended to new and intermediate R Markdown users who desire to enhance the efficiency of using R Markdown and also explore the power of R Markdown. References "],["how-to-read-this-book.html", "How to read this book", " How to read this book It is recommended that readers have a basic understanding of R Markdown. Chapter 2 of R Markdown: The Definitive Guide (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018) provides an overview of the basics of R Markdown and is recommended background reading for any new users of R Markdown. For example, we did not cover Markdown syntax in this book, and expect readers to learn Markdown elsewhere. In particular, we strongly recommend that you go through the full manual of Pandoc at least once. The manual is quite lengthy, but it is also a gold mine. You do not have to remember everything, but it will be very helpful if you are aware of the possible features of Markdown. For countless times, I have seen people fail to write verbatim code blocks that contain three backticks, or list items that contain child elements. Without fully reading the Markdown syntax in the manual, perhaps you will never know or understand the rule “N + 1 outer backticks for N inner backticks” or “indent properly to indicate child elements.” We do not intend to provide a full technical reference for R Markdown in this cookbook. This cookbook aims to supplement, instead of replace, the existing literature. Therefore, readers may explore the following books if they want to seek further information: R Markdown: The Definitive Guide (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018), the technical reference for all R Markdown output formats in the rmarkdown package and several other extension packages. Part V (“Communicate”) of R for Data Science (Wickham and Grolemund 2016). This part is less technical than the above “Definitive Guide,” and hence may be a gentler introduction to R Markdown. Dynamic Documents with R and knitr (Xie 2015) provides a thorough introduction to the knitr package (Xie 2026a) (note that R Markdown is only one of the document formats that knitr supports). If you want to read a shorter version, you may find Karl Broman’s minimal tutorial “knitr in a knutshell” helpful. bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown (Xie 2016) is a short book as the official documentation of the bookdown package (Xie 2025b), which is designed to simplify the creation of long-format documents in R Markdown. blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown (Xie, Hill, and Thomas 2017) introduces how to create websites in R Markdown with the blogdown package (Xie, Dervieux, and Presmanes Hill 2026). Where relevant, this book provides references to these existing resources. By the way, the official R Markdown website also contains a lot of resources that you may find helpful: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. You do not need to read this book in a particular order. Later chapters are not necessarily more challenging than previous chapters. The chapters and sections that we consider to be more advanced than others are marked with an asterisk (*) in their titles. It may be most efficient to read this book when you have some specific tasks in mind that you want to do with R Markdown, otherwise you can thumb through the table of contents and see if you are interested in any particular parts. We have tried to make each section and example as self-contained as possible, so you do not have to go back and forth among different parts of this book. In some cases, cross-referencing is unavoidable, and we will refer you to the background knowledge required to understand a certain example. If you want to try the examples by yourself, the full source code of this book and examples are freely provided on GitHub at https://github.com/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook. If you are reading the electronic version of this book, you may also just copy and paste the examples from the pages and run them in your favorite editor. References "],["structure-of-the-book.html", "Structure of the book", " Structure of the book The book is broken down into small “recipes” that aim to demonstrate a single concept at a time. Chapter 1 provides instructions on how to install the necessary software tools. Chapter 2 gives a conceptual overview of R Markdown. Chapter 3 introduces the basic components of R Markdown, and how to convert between R Markdown documents and R scripts. Chapter 4 tells you how to generate certain document elements, such as page breaks, bibliographies, numbered figures, animations, diagrams, etc. Chapter 5 shows how to format content, such as adjusting the figure size and alignment. Chapter 6 introduces tips and tricks for those who only want LaTeX/PDF output. Similarly, Chapter 7 is for HTML users, and Chapter 8 is for Word users. If you want to produce output documents in multiple output formats (which is often tricky), you may find Chapter 9 useful. Chapter 10 is, to be honest, my least favorite chapter, but I know a lot of users really want to learn how to produce tables. I’m not an expert on fancy tables, but hope you will at least find the list of packages there helpful. Chapter 11 shows some applications of knitr’s chunk options that you may not know. Chapter 12 and Chapter 13 are a little advanced, but should also be very useful because they show you the great power of being able to control knitr’s output and behavior with custom hook functions. Chapter 14 introduces a variety of knitr tricks. Chapter 15 shows examples of using other languages in R Markdown, so you know R Markdown is not only for R. It also teaches you how to make knitr work with a new language that has not been supported yet. Chapter 16 introduces tips on managing projects related to R Markdown. Chapter 17 presents some tips on enhancing your workflow. The recipes in this book are usually independent of each other, so you can pick up any one to read if you do not have a specific goal in mind.

"],["acknowledgments.html", "Acknowledgments", " Acknowledgments As usual, first I want to thank my employer RStudio for giving me the freedom to work on this book. Since I started working on it, my weekly meeting time with my manager, Tareef Kawaf, was first reduced from 15 minutes to 5 minutes, and then the meetings were just canceled. I have heard from several friends that they have too many unbearable meetings in their institutions, which waste a lot of their time. In terms of managing distractions, one of them recently lamented, “You may be able to mute Slack for five minutes, but can you possibly mute it for a whole day?” “Of course, I can!” I told her. I can probably mute it for a whole month if I like. Do not get me wrong—I do not mean Tareef or my colleagues are distractions. I only mean how much freedom they can offer me. I came up with the idea of writing this cookbook after I published the R Markdown Definitive Guide, but ideas are often cheap. It is the execution that is hard and expensive. If it were not for Michael Harper’s initial pushing, I would never have started working on it seriously. Christophe Dervieux has always been around whenever I need help. He used his R and R Markdown skills to build a dashboard (with the flexdashboard package) to guide me to the potentially interesting and useful topics to write on. Meanwhile, he has also helped me in numerous other GitHub issues, so I could have more time for writing the book, instead of spending whole days on wrestling with bug reports that do not have minimal reproducible examples attached. Similarly, several people have been helping with answering R Markdown questions on Stack Overflow, including Martin Schmelzer, Marcel Schilling, and Ralf Stubner. Perhaps it was not their intention to save me time, but their effort did save me a lot of time. Recently, Johannes Friedrich also came to my attention on Stack Overflow, after a few times when I opened a new Stack Overflow question only to find it already answered by him. David Keyes saved my life in Section 10.3, since he had written a wonderful blog post to introduce several R packages to create tables, with which I was not very familiar. Other online materials that have helped me a lot include Holtz Yan’s post on some R Markdown tips, Nicholas Tierney’s book R Markdown for Scientists, Maëlle Salmon’s R Markdown course, Jennifer Thompson’s R Markdown course, Emi Tanaka’s R Markdown workshop, Alison Hill’s R Markdown workshop (co-taught with me), and Alison Hill and Emi Tanaka’s R Markdown workshop. Many people have made contributions in the GitHub repository of this book by either sending pull requests or filing issues, including Maria Bekker-Nielsen Dunbar, Nathan Eastwood, Johannes Friedrich, Krishnakumar Gopalakrishnan, Xiangyun Huang, Florian Kohrt, Romain Lesur, Jiaxiang Li, Song Li, Ulrik Lyngs, Matt Small, Jake Stephen, Atsushi Yasumoto, Hao Zhu, and John Zobolas. The marvelous cover artwork of this book was designed by Allison Horst and the full cover was finalized by Kevin Craig. The original idea of this book was partially motivated from a remote talk that I delivered to the RaukR Summer School in 2018, in which I introduced some lesser known features of knitr. The audience seemed to like those short introductions of knitr features, which were like recipes. I’d like to thank the organizers of the summer school, including Marcin Kierczak and Sebastian Dilorenzo, for inviting me. I have given similar talks later at Genentech and DahShu. I want to thank Michael Lawrence and Yuqing Zhang for the invitations, as well as the audience of these talks, for their feedback. Paul Johnson published a very helpful critique of our book R Markdown: The Definitive Guide in the journal The American Statistician in 2020. He complained that the book lacked in-depth examples, therefore the definitive guide was not definitive enough. I truly appreciate and agree with his comments. I hope this new (cook)book can fill the gap. This is the fifth book that I have published with my editor John Kimmel. It has always been a pleasure to work with him and the team at Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC. I’m excited every time John tells me the new success of bookdown as it is more widely adopted by other authors. I feel honored to hear from John that Suzanne Lassandro, the production editor of my previous books, still tried hard to help with this book even though she has many other responsibilities and rarely works directly with authors now. Suzanne and our proofreader (Rebecca Condit) managed to identify “only” 377 issues in our first draft. Apparently, I was too optimistic when I wondered last time if I would have less than 30 issues in my next book. The LaTeX expert Shashi Kumar helped us fix a thorny LaTeX issue, which was our last obstacle before the PDF could be printed. John reached out to several reviewers for their feedback on the manuscript. Eventually we received nine great reviews. One of them was so great that we could not help inviting her to co-author this book! It was a lot of work to deal with the nine reviews, but it was definitely worth the effort. I’d like to thank all these reviewers for their helpful feedback, including Carl Boettiger, John Blischak, Sharla Gelfand, Johannes Friedrich, Atsushi Yasumoto, and other anonymous reviewers. I worked on the last part of this book in the vacant house (without Internet!) of my good old neighbors, Dong Guo and Qian Jia, after they moved to another city. I’m grateful to them for letting me use their house as my temporary office to finish up the book when I felt rather exhausted and needed a quiet environment. It was sad to say goodbye to them. To me, this book, finished in their house, will also be associated with some of my fond memories of this family, including their parents and lovely little daughter. Lastly, I will definitely not miss this unique opportunity to thank my two little “super helpful co-workers” (5 and 3) at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, without whom I could have published this book five months earlier. Now I miss the teachers at their daycare center (Small Miracle) and feel daycare centers are perhaps not that expensive… Yihui Xie Elkhorn, Nebraska "],["author.html", "About the Authors", " About the Authors Yihui typed out most of the words in this book, which is the only justification for him being the “first” author. Christophe has made substantial contribution to this book by helping Yihui organize all the GitHub issues and occasionally writing a few sections. Emily was originally a reviewer of this book. Since Yihui was not patient enough to deal with her lengthy comments, he invited her to become a co-author of this book (out of revenge) to feel his pain of having to deal with so many additional things when he thought he was pretty much done! Just kidding… No, he invited her out of full appreciation, because her comments were so helpful, yet Yihui lacked the time to do all the improvements that she suggested. When you see the pronoun “I” in this book, it refers to Yihui. Using “I” instead of “We” does not mean the co-authors were forgotten, but Yihui wanted to express certain opinions completely on his own. He certainly wants to appear smart, but in case he is actually silly, he wants to be silly alone.

There are not many types of food that he cannot resist eating, and spicy food is one of the few. Since cooking is more fun, he rarely goes to restaurants. When he does go and is asked “how spicy you want your food to be” in the restaurant, he usually answers “as spicy as your chef can make it to be.” References "],["christophe-dervieux.html", "Christophe Dervieux", " Christophe Dervieux Christophe Dervieux is an active member of the R community, currently living in France.

"],["installation.html", "Chapter 1 Installation", " Chapter 1 Installation To use R Markdown, you have to install R (R Core Team 2025) and the R package rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2025). # install the rmarkdown package from CRAN in R install.packages(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;) # or install from GitHub if you want to test the # development version if (!requireNamespace(&quot;remotes&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;remotes&quot;) remotes::install_github(&quot;rstudio/rmarkdown&quot;) Unless you have a favorite editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment), we recommend that you also install the RStudio IDE (https://www.rstudio.com). RStudio is not required, but it will make it easier for an average user to work with R Markdown because of the strong editor support. If you choose not to use the RStudio IDE, you will need to install Pandoc (see Section 1.1), which is the tool used by rmarkdown to convert Markdown to other document formats. If you need to create PDF output, you may need to install LaTeX (Section 1.2) and certain LaTeX packages (Section 1.3). References "],["install-pandoc.html", "1.1 Use a Pandoc version not bundled with the RStudio IDE", " 1.1 Use a Pandoc version not bundled with the RStudio IDE The RStudio IDE has bundled a version of Pandoc, so you do not need to install Pandoc by yourself if you use the RStudio IDE. However, for some advanced usage, the bundled version may differ from the exact version you want. You can choose to install a separate copy of Pandoc by yourself. Please remember that the bundled version may be more thoroughly tested with R Markdown, because most RStudio users may just use the bundled version. If you want to go with a different version (especially a higher version), you might run into problems that other R Markdown users or developers have yet to discover. Some configurations are required if you have installed a specific Pandoc version by yourself. First, before running rmarkdown::render(), you may inform the rmarkdown package by calling the function rmarkdown::find_pandoc() in the same R session, e.g., # to find a specific version (e.g., if lower version # on PATH) rmarkdown::find_pandoc(version = &quot;2.9.1&quot;) # to find Pandoc under a specific directory (e.g., if # a specific version cannot be in PATH) rmarkdown::find_pandoc(dir = &quot;~/Downloads/Pandoc&quot;) # ignore the previously found Pandoc and search again # (i.e., opt out of the caching mechanism). rmarkdown::find_pandoc(cache = FALSE) As you can see in the above code chunk, several ways exist to find a version of Pandoc. By default, rmarkdown::find_pandoc() tries to find your system’s highest version of Pandoc. Once found, the version information is cached, and you can invalidate the cache with cache = FALSE. Please see the help page ?rmarkdown::find_pandoc for the potential directories where the pandoc executable may be found. This function needs to be called outside of the Rmd document, as rmarkdown may use the Pandoc version information before knitting with code cells execution happens. If you want an Rmd document to be compiled by a specific version of Pandoc installed on your computer, the pandoc package (Dervieux 2023) will help. This package is designed to help test R code with different Pandoc versions. It allows installing and managing several Pandoc binary versions on the system and easily switching between versions. The function pandoc::with_pandoc_version() can help to render a document with a specific version of Pandoc, e.g., the following will render the document with Pandoc 2.9.1: pandoc::with_pandoc_version( version = &#39;2.9.1&#39;, rmarkdown::render(&#39;input.Rmd&#39;) ) The pandoc package works by default with its Pandoc binaries installation. See ?pandoc::pandoc_install() for installation instructions of 2.9.1 in the example and, more generally, the Get Started article. For use with the Knit button in RStudio (See Section 17.5 about Knit button customization.), you can also customize the behavior like this: knit: (function(input, ...) { pandoc::with_pandoc_version(&quot;2.9.1&quot;, rmarkdown::render(input)) }) pandoc::with_pandoc_version() is a wrapper for rmarkdown::find_pandoc(), so you could also get inspiration from it to use your own version. See ?pandoc::with_pandoc_version() for more details. References "],["install-latex.html", "1.2 Install LaTeX (TinyTeX) for PDF reports", " 1.2 Install LaTeX (TinyTeX) for PDF reports If you would like to create PDF documents from R Markdown, you will need to have a LaTeX distribution installed. Although there are several traditional options including MiKTeX, MacTeX, and TeX Live, we recommend that R Markdown users install TinyTeX. TinyTeX is a custom LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live that is relatively small in size, but functions well in most cases, especially for R users. Installing or running TinyTeX does not require sysadmin privileges.1 You can install TinyTeX with the R package tinytex (Xie 2025c): tinytex::install_tinytex() # to uninstall TinyTeX, run # tinytex::uninstall_tinytex() Please note that “tinytex” refers to the R package, and “TinyTeX” refers to the LaTeX distribution. There are two advantages of using TinyTeX: TinyTeX is lightweight (compared to other LaTeX distributions), cross-platform, and portable. For example, you can store a copy of TinyTeX on your USB drive or other portable devices, and use it on other computers with the same operating system. When R Markdown is converted to PDF, Pandoc converts Markdown to an intermediate LaTeX document first. The R package tinytex has provided helper functions to compile LaTeX documents to PDF (the main function is tinytex::latexmk()). If you use TinyTeX and certain LaTeX packages are required but not installed, tinytex will try to automatically install them for you. It will also try to compile the LaTeX file for a sufficient number of times to make sure all cross-references are resolved. If you are interested in the technical details, you may check out the article Xie (2019) and the FAQ page at https://yihui.org/tinytex/faq/. References "],["install-latex-pkgs.html", "1.3 Install missing LaTeX packages", " 1.3 Install missing LaTeX packages When you compile a document to PDF through LaTeX, you may run into errors like these: !

This function takes the path of the LaTeX log file as the input, tries to figure out the missing packages automatically, and installs them if they are found on CTAN (the Comprehensive TEX Archive Network, https://ctan.org). The LaTeX log file typically has the same base name as your input document, and has an extension .log. If you cannot find this log file, you can pass the error message to the text argument of this function. Both ways should work: # if the log file is filename.log tinytex::parse_install(&quot;filename.log&quot;) # or use the `text` argument tinytex::parse_install( text = &quot;! LaTeX Error: File `ocgbase.sty&#39; not found.&quot; ) # it will install the &quot;ocgx2&quot; package If you do not use TinyTeX, the R package tinytex can still help you figure out the LaTeX package names from the error log—use the function tinytex::parse_packages(), e.g., # if the log file is filename.log tinytex::parse_packages(&quot;filename.log&quot;) # or use the `text` argument tinytex::parse_packages( text = &quot;! LaTeX Error: File `ocgbase.sty&#39; not found.&quot; ) # it should return &quot;ocgx2&quot; Once you know the package names, you can install them with the package manager of your LaTeX distribution. If you are using MiKTeX instead, it can also install missing packages automatically. During the installation of MiKTeX, be sure to check the setting “Always install missing packages on-the-fly.” If you have already installed it without this setting, you can still change it in the MiKTeX Console.

The following chapters demonstrate techniques to write more efficient and succinct code and to customize your output. Before we begin, it may be helpful to learn just a bit more about how R Markdown works, to help you to understand, remember, apply, and “remix” these tricks. In this section, we provide a brief overview of the process of knitting a document and the “key levers to pull” to change the output. This material is not necessary to understand the subsequent chapters (so feel free to skip ahead!), but it may help you to build a richer mental model for how all the pieces fit together. "],["rmarkdown-process.html", "2.1 What happens when we render?", " 2.1 What happens when we render? R Markdown combines several different processes together to create documents, and one of the main sources of confusion from R Markdown is how all the components work together.2 Fortunately, as a user, it is not essential to understand all the inner workings of these processes to be able to create documents. However, as a user who may be seeking to alter the behavior of a document, it is important to understand which component is responsible for what. This makes it a lot easier to seek help as you can target your searches on the correct area. The basic workflow structure for an R Markdown document is shown in Figure 2.1, highlighting the steps (arrows) and the intermediate files that are created before producing the output. The whole process is implemented via the function rmarkdown::render(). Each stage is explained in further detail below. FIGURE 2.1: A diagram illustrating how an R Markdown document is converted to the final output document. The .Rmd document is the original format of the document. It contains a combination of YAML (metadata), text (narratives), and code chunks. First, the knit() function in knitr (Xie 2026a) is used to execute all code embedded within the .Rmd file, and prepare the code output to be displayed within the output document. All these results are converted into the correct markup language to be contained within the temporary .md file. Then the .md file is processed by Pandoc, a multipurpose tool designed to convert files from one markup language to another. It takes any parameters specified within the YAML frontmatter of the document (e.g., title, author, and date) to convert the document to the output format specified in the output parameter (such as html_document for HTML output). If the output format is PDF, there is an additional layer of processing, as Pandoc will convert the intermediate .md file into an intermediate .tex file. This file is then processed by LaTeX to form the final PDF document. As we mentioned in Section 1.2, the rmarkdown package calls the latexmk() function in the tinytex package (Xie 2025c), which in turn calls LaTeX to compile .tex to .pdf. In short, rmarkdown::render() = knitr::knit() + Pandoc (+ LaTeX for PDF output only). Robin Linacre has written a nice summary of the relationship between R Markdown, knitr, and Pandoc at https://stackoverflow.com/q/40563479/559676, which contains more technical details than the above overview. Note that not all R Markdown documents are eventually compiled through Pandoc. The intermediate .md file could be compiled by other Markdown renderers. Below are two examples: The xaringan package (Xie 2025d) passes the .md output to a JavaScript library, which renders the Markdown content in the web browser. The blogdown package (Xie, Dervieux, and Presmanes Hill 2026) supports the .Rmarkdown document format, which is knitted to .markdown, and this Markdown document is usually rendered to HTML by an external site generator.

Specifically, let’s look at when and how these are altered during the rendering workflow. 2.2.1 YAML metadata The YAML metadata (also called the YAML header) is processed in many stages of the rendering process and can influence the final document in many different ways. It is placed at the very beginning of the document and is read by each of Pandoc, rmarkdown, and knitr. Along the way, the information that it contains can affect the code, content, and the rendering process. A typical YAML header looks like this, and contains basic metadata about the document and rendering instructions: --- title: My R Markdown Report author: Yihui Xie output: html_document --- In this case, the title and author fields are processed by Pandoc to set the values of template variables. With the default template, the title and author information will appear at the beginning of the resulting document. More details on how Pandoc uses information from the YAML header are included in the Pandoc manual’s section on the YAML metadata block. In contrast, the output field is used by rmarkdown to apply the output format function rmarkdown::html_document() in the rendering process. We can further influence the rendering process by passing arguments to the output format that we are specifying in output. For example, writing: output: html_document: toc: true toc_float: true is the equivalent of telling rmarkdown::render() to apply the output format rmarkdown::html_document(toc = TRUE, toc_float = TRUE). To find out what these options do, and to learn about other possible options, you may run ?rmarkdown::html_document in your R console and read the help page. Note that output: html_document is equivalent to output: rmarkdown::html_document. When an output format does not have a qualifier like rmarkdown::, it is assumed that it is from the rmarkdown package, otherwise it must be prefixed with the R package name, e.g., bookdown::html_document2. The YAML header can also influence our content and code if we choose to use parameters in YAML, as described in Section 17.4. In short, we can include variables and R expressions in this header that can be referenced throughout our R Markdown document. For example, the following header defines start_date and end_date parameters, which will be reflected in a list called params later in the R Markdown document. Thus, if we want to use these values in our R code, we can access them via params$start_date and params$end_date. --- title: My RMarkdown author: Yihui Xie output: html_document params: start_date: &#39;2020-01-01&#39; end_date: &#39;2020-06-01&#39; --- 2.2.2 Narrative The narrative textual elements of R Markdown may be simpler to understand than the YAML metadata and code chunks. Typically, this will feel quite a bit like writing in a text editor. However, this Markdown content can be more powerful and interesting than simple text—both in how its content is made, and how the document structure is made from it. While much of our narrative is human-written, many R Markdown documents will likely wish to reference the code and analysis being used. For this reason, Chapter 4 demonstrates the many ways that code can help generate parts of the text, such as combining words into a list (Section 4.11) or writing a bibliography (Section 4.5). This conversion is handled by knitr as we convert from .Rmd to .md. Our Markdown text can also provide structure to the document. While we do not have enough space here to review the Markdown syntax,3 one particularly relevant concept is section headers, which are denoted by one or more hashes (#) corresponding to different levels, e.g., # First-level header ## Second-level header ### Third-level header These headers give structure to our entire document as rmarkdown converts the .md to our final output format. This structure is useful for referencing and formatting these sections by appending certain attributes to them. To create such references, Pandoc syntax allows us to provide a unique identifier by following the header notation with {#id}, or attach one or more classes to a section with {.class-name}, e.g., ## Second-level header {#introduction .important .large} We can then access this section with many of the tools that you will learn, e.g., by referencing it with its ID or class. As examples, Section 4.7 demonstrates how to use the section ID to make cross-references throughout your document, and Section 7.6 introduces the .tabset class to help reorganize subsections. The final interesting type of content that we might find in the textual part of our R Markdown is raw content written specifically for our desired output format, e.g., raw LaTeX code for LaTeX output (Section 6.11), raw HTML code for HTML output, and so on (Section 9.5). Raw content may help you achieve things that cannot be done with plain Markdown, but please keep in mind that it is usually ignored when the output format is a different format, e.g., raw LaTeX commands in Markdown will be ignored when the output format is HTML. 2.2.3 Code chunks Code chunks are the beating heart of our R Markdown. The code in these chunks is run by knitr, and its output is translated to Markdown to dynamically keep our reports in sync with our current scripts and data. Each code chunk consists of a language engine (Chapter 15), an optional label, chunk options (Chapter 11), and code. To understand some of the modifications that we can make to code chunks, it is worth understanding the knitr process in slightly more detail. For each chunk, a knitr language engine gets three pieces of input: the knitting environment (knitr::knit_global()), the code input, and a list of chunk options. It returns the formatted representations of the code as well as its output. As a side effect, the knitting environment may also be modified, e.g., new variables may have been created in this environment via the source code in the code chunk. This process is illustrated in Figure 2.2. FIGURE 2.2: A flowchart of inputs and outputs to a language engine. We can modify this process by: changing our language engine; modifying chunk options, which can be global, local, or engine-specific; and by using hooks (Chapter 12 and Chapter 13) to further process these inputs and outputs. For example, in Section 12.1, you will learn how to add a hook to post-process the code output to redact certain lines in the source code. Code chunks also have analogous concepts to the classes and unique identifiers that we explored for narratives in Section 2.2.2. A code chunk can specify an optional identifier (often called the “chunk label”) immediately after its language engine. It can set classes for code and text output blocks in the output document via the chunk options class.source and class.output, respectively (see Section 7.3). For example, the chunk header ```{r summary-stats, class.output = 'large-text'} gives this chunk a label summary-stats, and the class large-text for the text output blocks. A chunk can have only one label, but can have multiple classes. 2.2.4 Document body One important thing to understand when authoring and modifying a document is how code and narrative pieces create different sections, or containers within the document. For example, suppose we have a document that looks like this: # Title ## Section X This is my introduction. ```{r chunk-x} x &lt;- 1 print(x) ``` ### Subsection 1 Here are some details. ### Subsection 2 These are more details. ## Section Y This is another section. ```{r chunk-y} y &lt;- 2 print(y) ``` When writing this document, we might think of each piece as linear with independent sections of text and code following in a sequence one after the other. However, what we are actually doing is creating a set of nested containers that conceptually4 looks more like Figure 2.3. FIGURE 2.3: A simple R Markdown document illustrated as a set of nested containers. Two key features of this diagram are (1) every section of text or code is its own discrete container, and (2) containers can be nested within one another. This nesting is particularly apparent if you are authoring your R Markdown document in the RStudio IDE and expand the document outline. Note that in Figure 2.3, headers of the same level represent containers at the same level of nesting. Lower-level headers exist inside of the container of higher-level headers. In this case, it is common to call the higher-level sections the “parent” and the minor sections the “child.” For example, a subsection is the child of a section. Besides headers, you can also create divisions in your text using :::, as demonstrated in Section 5.8. This structure has important implications as we attempt to apply some of the formatting and styling options that are described in this text. For example, we will see this nested structure when we learn about how Pandoc represents our document as an abstract syntax tree (Section 4.20), or when we use CSS selectors (Section 7.1, among others) to style our HTML output. Formatting and styling can be applied to either containers of similar types (e.g., all code blocks), or all containers that exist inside of another container (e.g., everything under “Section Y”). Additionally, as explained in Section 2.2.2, we can apply the same classes to certain sections to designate them as being similar, and in this case, the common class names denote the common properties or intent of these sections. As you read through this cookbook, it may be useful to quiz yourself and think about what sort of container the specific “recipe” is acting upon. Instead, for a review of the Markdown syntax, please see https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-syntax.html.↩︎ In reality, there are many more containers than shown. For example, for a knitted code chunk, the code and output exist in separate containers that share a common parent.↩︎ "],["what-to-change.html", "2.3 What can we change to change the results?", " 2.3 What can we change to change the results? Let’s summarize what we have seen so far and preview what is to come. Rendering R Markdown documents with rmarkdown consists of converting .Rmd to .md with knitr, and then .md to our desired output with Pandoc (typically). The .Rmd-to-.md step handles the execution and “translation” of all code within our report, so most changes to content involve editing the .Rmd with code for knitr to translate. Tools that we have control over these steps include knitr chunk options and hooks. Our .md is a plain text file with no formatting. This is where Pandoc comes in to convert to the final output format such as HTML, PDF, or Word. Along the way, we add structure and style. A wide range of tools to help us in this process include style sheets (CSS), raw LaTeX or HTML code, Pandoc templates, and Lua filters. By understanding the nested structure of an R Markdown document, and by thoughtfully using identifiers and classes, we can apply some of these tools selectively to targeted parts of our output. Finally, our YAML metadata may help us toggle any of these steps. Changing parameters can change how our code runs, changing metadata alters the text content, and changing output options provides the render() function with a different set of instructions. Of course, these are all rough heuristics and should not be taken as absolute facts. Ultimately, there is not a completely clear division of labor. Throughout this book, you will see that there are often multiple valid paths to achieving many of the outcomes described in this book, and these may enter different stages of the pipeline. For example, for the simple task of inserting an image in your document, you may either use the R code knitr::include_graphics(), which would execute in the .Rmd to .md stage, or directly use Markdown syntax (![]()). This may seem confusing, and sometimes different approaches will have different advantages. However, do not be concerned—if anything, this often means there are many valid ways to solve your problem, and you can follow whichever approach makes the most sense to you. And that’s that! In the rest of the book, you can now color in this rough sketch with many more concrete examples of ways to modify all of the components that we have discussed to get the most value out of R Markdown. "],["basics.html", "Chapter 3 Basics", " Chapter 3 Basics In this chapter, we present some key concepts about R Markdown. First, we introduce the basic components of an R Markdown document: the prose and code. Next, we show how to convert R Markdown documents to R scripts, and vice versa. For those seeking lower-level basics, please read Chapter 2 of the R Markdown Definitive Guide (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018). References "],["r-code.html", "3.1 Code chunks and inline R code", " 3.1 Code chunks and inline R code An R Markdown document consists of intermingled prose (narratives) and code. There are two types of code in an Rmd document: code chunks and inline R code. Below is a quick example: ```{r} x &lt;- 5 # radius of a circle ``` For a circle with the radius `r x`, its area is `r pi * x^2`. A code chunk usually starts with ```{} and ends with ```. You can write any number of lines of code in it. Inline R code is embedded in the narratives of the document using the syntax `r `. In the above example, we defined a variable x in a code chunk, which is the radius of a circle, and calculated its area in the next paragraph. You can customize the behavior and output of code chunks through chunk options (provided inside the curly brackets {}). You will find several examples in Chapter 11. You may write code of other languages in code chunks, too (see Chapter 15).

You can find the full documentation at https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/. FIGURE 3.1: The visual Markdown editor in RStudio. With the visual editor, you can visually edit almost any Markdown elements supported by Pandoc, such as section headers, figures, tables, footnotes, and so on. That means you do not have remember the syntax for all elements. In case you forget the syntax for a certain element, you may use the RStudio toolbar (see Figure 3.1) or a keyboard shortcut to add or edit it. If you are already a Markdown expert, you can still write your document in the source mode by clicking the rightmost button on the toolbar, which allows you to switch between the source mode and the visual mode. "],["spin.html", "3.3 Render an R script to a report", " 3.3 Render an R script to a report Even if you are a long-time R Markdown user, you may have missed another possibility. Dean Attali called it “knitr’s best hidden gem”. That is, you can render a pure R script to a report directly. If you use the RStudio IDE, the keyboard shortcut to render R scripts is the same as when you knit Rmd documents (Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + K). Or equivalently, you can call rmarkdown::render() on the R script. When rendering an R script to a report via rmarkdown::render(), the function knitr::spin() is called under the hood to convert the R script to an Rmd file first. This function is what Dean Attali called knitr’s best hidden gem. You will see all text and graphical output in the report. If you want granular control over the elements in the report, below are a few syntax rules to help you: Roxygen comments will be treated as normal text. A roxygen comment is an R comment that starts with #'. This can help you write narratives in your report. You can use any Markdown syntax in the comments. A comment starting with #+ is treated as the knitr chunk header. For example, knitr::spin() will translate the comment #+ label, fig.width=5 to the chunk header ```{r label, fig.width=5} in R Markdown. R code of the form {{ code }} is translated to an inline R expression in R Markdown. Please note that {{ code }} must be on its own line. The YAML frontmatter can be written in the beginning of the R script in roxygen comments, too. Please watch out for the indentation in YAML fields. It is very important. If you omit the indentation, the data structure expressed in your YAML will be different and incorrect. For example, the field keep_tex: true should be indented for two more spaces under pdf_document in the example below. Any text between /* and */ will be ignored (i.e., they are treated as true comments). Below is a full example illustrating the above rules: #&#39; --- #&#39; title: &quot;A report generated from a pure R script&quot; #&#39; output: #&#39; pdf_document: #&#39; keep_tex: true #&#39; --- #&#39; #&#39; This is a report generated by `knitr::spin()`. #&#39; #&#39; Let&#39;s try some **knitr** options: #+ echo=FALSE, fig.width=7 # This is a normal R comment. plot(cars) #&#39; Now write an inline value. We know the value of $\\pi$ is {{ pi }} #&#39; . #&#39; #&#39; Finally please note that all roxygen comments are #&#39; optional. You do not need chunk options, either, #&#39; unless you want more control over the output #&#39; elements such as the size of plots. # /* Write comments between /* and */ like C comments: Sys.sleep(60) # */ When this script is rendered to a report, knitr::spin() will convert it to R Markdown: --- title: &quot;A report generated from a pure R script&quot; output: pdf_document: keep_tex: true --- This is a report generated by `knitr::spin()`. Let&#39;s try some **knitr** options: ```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7} # This is a normal R comment. plot(cars) ``` Now write an inline value. We know the value of $\\pi$ is ``r pi `` . Finally please note that all roxygen comments are optional. You do not need chunk options, either, unless you want more control over the output elements such as the size of plots. This method of generating reports can be particularly useful when you primarily work with R scripts and do not need a lot of narratives. If the proportion of text is substantial in your report, R Markdown may be a better choice, because you do not need to put all text in roxygen comments.

"],["notebook.html", "3.5 R Markdown Notebooks", " 3.5 R Markdown Notebooks As mentioned in Section 2.2 of the R Markdown Definitive Guide (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018), there are several ways to compile an Rmd document. One of them is to use R Markdown Notebooks, with the output format html_notebook, e.g., --- title: An R Markdown Notebook output: html_notebook --- When you use this output format in RStudio, the Knit button on the toolbar will become the Preview button. The main advantage of using notebooks is that you can work on an Rmd document iteratively in the same R session. You can run one code chunk at a time by clicking the green arrow button on each chunk, and you will see the text or plot output in the editor. When you click the Preview button on the toolbar, it only renders the Rmd document to an HTML output document containing the output of all code chunks that you have already executed. The Preview button does not execute any code chunks. By comparison, when you use other output formats and hit the Knit button, RStudio launches a new R session to compile the whole document (hence all code chunks are executed at once), which usually takes more time. If you do not like RStudio’s default behavior of showing the output of code chunks inline when you run them individually, you can uncheck the option “Show output inline for all R Markdown documents” from the menu Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; R Markdown. After that, when you run a code chunk, the output will be shown in the R console instead of inside the source editor.

For example: --- title: Breaking pages output: pdf_document: default word_document: default html_document: default odt_document: default --- # The first section \\newpage # The second section This feature is based on Pandoc’s Lua filters (see Section 4.20). For those who are interested in the technology, you may view this package vignette: vignette(&quot;lua-filters&quot;, package = &quot;rmarkdown&quot;) For HTML output, page breaks only make sense when you print the HTML page, otherwise you will not see the page breaks, because an HTML page is just a single continuous page.↩︎ "],["dynamic-yaml.html", "4.2 Set the document title dynamically", " 4.2 Set the document title dynamically You can use inline R code (see Section 3.1) anywhere in an Rmd document, including the YAML metadata section. This means some YAML metadata can be dynamically generated with inline R code, such as the document title. For example: --- title: &quot;An analysis of `r nrow(mtcars)` cars&quot; --- If your title depends on an R variable created later in the document, you may add the title field in a later YAML section, e.g., the following: --- author: &quot;Smart Analyst&quot; output: pdf_document --- I just tried really hard to calculate our market share: ```{r} share &lt;- runif(1) ``` --- title: &quot;Our market share is `r round(100 * share, 2)`% now!&quot; --- I feel `r if(share &gt; 0.8) &quot;happy&quot; else &quot;sad&quot;` about it. In the example above, we added the document title after we created the variable share. The title works in this case because Pandoc can read any number of YAML sections in a document (and merge them). You can also generate titles or any YAML fields dynamically from parameters in parameterized reports (see Section 17.4), e.g., --- title: &quot;`r params$doc_title`&quot; author: &quot;Smart Analyst&quot; params: doc_title: &quot;The Default Title&quot; --- With the title being a dynamic parameter, you can easily generate a batch of reports with different titles.

You can also add other attributes to the heading, e.g., {.unnumbered #section-id}. Please see https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-header_attributes for more information. Unnumbered sections are often used for providing extra information about the writing. For example, for this book, the chapters “Preface” and “About the Authors” are unnumbered, since they do not belong to the body of this book.

"],["bibliography.html", "4.5 Bibliographies and citations", " 4.5 Bibliographies and citations For an overview of including bibliographies in your output document, you may see Section 2.8 of Xie (2016). The basic usage requires us to specify a bibliography file using the bibliography metadata field in YAML. For example: --- output: html_document bibliography: references.bib --- where the BibTeX database is a plain-text file with the *.bib extension that consists of bibliography entries like this: @Manual{R-base, title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing}, author = {{R Core Team}}, organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing}, address = {Vienna, Austria}, year = {2019}, url = {https://www.R-project.org}, } Items can be cited directly within the documentation using the syntax @key where key is the citation key in the first line of the entry, e.g., @R-base. To put citations in parentheses, use [@key]. To cite multiple entries, separate the keys by semicolons, e.g., [@key-1; @key-2; @key-3]. To suppress the mention of the author, add a minus sign before @, e.g., [-@R-base]. 4.5.1 Changing citation style By default, Pandoc will use a Chicago author-date format for citations and references. To use another style, you will need to specify a CSL (Citation Style Language) file in the csl metadata field, e.g., --- output: html_document bibliography: references.bib csl: biomed-central.csl --- To find your required formats, we recommend using the Zotero Style Repository, which makes it easy to search for and download your desired style. CSL files can be tweaked to meet custom formatting requirements. For example, we can change the number of authors required before “et al.” is used to abbreviate them. This can be simplified through the use of visual editors such as the one available at https://editor.citationstyles.org. 4.5.2 Add an item to a bibliography without using it By default, the bibliography will only display items that are directly referenced in the document. If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy nocite metadata field and put the citations there. --- nocite: | @item1, @item2 --- 4.5.3 Add all items to the bibliography If we do not wish to explicitly state all of the items within the bibliography but would still like to show them in our references, we can use the following syntax: --- nocite: &#39;@*&#39; --- This will force all items to be displayed in the bibliography. 4.5.4 Include appendix after bibliography (*) By default, the bibliography appears at the very end of the document. However, there can be cases in which we want to place additional text after the references, most typically if we wish to include appendices in the document. We can force the position of the references by using &lt;div id=\"refs\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;, as shown below: # References &lt;div id=&quot;refs&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; # Appendix Although &lt;div&gt; is an HTML tag, this method also works for other output formats such as PDF. We can improve this further by using the bookdown package (Xie 2025b), which allows you to insert a special header # (APPENDIX) Appendix {-} before you start the appendix, e.g., # References &lt;div id=&quot;refs&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; # (APPENDIX) Appendix {-} # More information This will be Appendix A. # One more thing This will be Appendix B. The numbering style of appendices will be automatically changed in LaTeX/PDF and HTML output (usually in the form A, A.1, A.2, B, B.1, and so on). References "],["write-bib.html", "4.6 Generate R package citations", " 4.6 Generate R package citations To cite an R package, you can use the function citation() from base R. If you want to generate a citation entry for BibTeX, you can pass the returned object of citation() to toBibtex(), e.g., toBibtex(citation(&quot;xaringan&quot;)) @Manual{, title = {xaringan: Presentation Ninja}, author = {Yihui Xie}, year = {2025}, note = {R package version 0.31}, url = {https://github.com/yihui/xaringan}, } To use citation entries generated from toBibtex(), you have to copy the output to a .bib file, and add citation keys (e.g., change @Manual{, to @Manual{R-xaringan,). This can be automated via the function knitr::write_bib(), which generates citation entries to a file and adds keys automatically, e.g., knitr::write_bib(c(.packages(), &quot;bookdown&quot;), &quot;packages.bib&quot;) The first argument should be a character vector of package names, and the second argument is the path to the .bib file. In the above example, .packages() returns the names of all packages loaded in the current R session. This makes sure all packages being used will have their citation entries written to the .bib file. When any of these packages are updated (e.g., the author, title, year, or version of a package is changed), write_bib() can automatically update the .bib file. There are two possible types of citation entries. One type is generated from the package’s DESCRIPTION file, and the other type is generated from the package’s CITATION file if provided. For the former type, the citation keys are of the form R-pkgname, where pkgname is the package name (e.g., R-knitr). For the latter type, the keys are created by concatenating the package name and the publication year (e.g., knitr2015). If there are multiple entries in the same year, a letter suffix will be added, e.g., knitr2015a and knitr2015b. The former type is often used to cite the package itself (i.e., the software), and the latter type often consists of publications related to the package, such as journal papers or books. knitr::write_bib(c(&quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;), width = 60) @Manual{R-knitr, title = {knitr: A General-Purpose Package for Dynamic Report Generation in R}, author = {Yihui Xie}, year = {2026}, note = {R package version 1.51.2}, url = {https://yihui.org/knitr/}, } @Manual{R-rmarkdown, title = {rmarkdown: Dynamic Documents for R}, author = {JJ Allaire and Yihui Xie and Christophe Dervieux and Jonathan McPherson and Javier Luraschi and Kevin Ushey and Aron Atkins and Hadley Wickham and Joe Cheng and Winston Chang and Richard Iannone}, year = {2025}, note = {R package version 2.30}, url = {https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown}, } @Book{knitr2015, title = {Dynamic Documents with {R} and knitr}, author = {Yihui Xie}, publisher = {Chapman and Hall/CRC}, address = {Boca Raton, Florida}, year = {2015}, edition = {2nd}, note = {ISBN 978-1498716963}, url = {https://yihui.org/knitr/}, } @InCollection{knitr2014, booktitle = {Implementing Reproducible Computational Research}, editor = {Victoria Stodden and Friedrich Leisch and Roger D.

Note that write_bib() is designed to overwrite the existing bibliography file. If you want to manually add any other entries to the bibliography, it is recommended that you create a second .bib file and refer to it in the YAML field bibliography, e.g., --- bibliography: [packages.bib, references.bib] --- ```{r, include=FALSE} knitr::write_bib(file = &#39;packages.bib&#39;) ``` In the above example, packages.bib is automatically generated, and you should not manually change it. All other citation entries can be manually written to references.bib. We only introduced one way to generate R package citations above. To dynamically generate citations for other types of literature, you may check out the knitcitations package (Boettiger 2021). References "],["cross-ref.html", "4.7 Cross-referencing within documents", " 4.7 Cross-referencing within documents Cross-referencing is a useful way of directing your readers through your document, and can be automatically done within R Markdown. While this has been explained in Chapter 2 from the bookdown book, we want to present a brief summary below. To use cross-references, you will need: A bookdown output format: Cross-referencing is not provided directly within the base rmarkdown package, but is provided as an extension in bookdown (Xie 2025b). We must therefore use an output format from bookdown (e.g., html_document2, pdf_document2, and word_document2, etc.) in the YAML output field. A caption to your figure (or table): Figures without a caption will be included directly as images and will therefore not be a numbered figure. A labeled code chunk: This provides the identifier for referencing the figure generated by the chunk. After these conditions are met, we can make cross-references within the text using the syntax \\@ref(type:label), where label is the chunk label and type is the environment being referenced (e.g. tab, fig, or eq). An example is provided below: --- title: Cross-referencing figures, tables, and equations author: Generated by bookdown output: bookdown::html_document2: default bookdown::pdf_document2: default --- See Figure \\@ref(fig:cars-plot). ```{r cars-plot, fig.cap=&quot;The cars data.&quot;, echo=FALSE} par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1)) plot(cars) # a scatterplot ``` Also see Equation \\@ref(eq:mean). \\begin{equation} \\bar{X} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n} (\\#eq:mean) \\end{equation} And see Table \\@ref(tab:mtcars). ```{r mtcars, echo=FALSE} knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5], caption = &quot;The mtcars data.&quot;) ``` The output of this document is shown in Figure 4.2. FIGURE 4.2: Example of cross-referencing within an R Markdown document. You can also cross-reference equations, theorems, and section headers. These types of references are explained further in Section 2.2 and Section 2.6 of the bookdown book.

If you wish to customize the format of the dates, you can alter the time format by providing your own format string.

If we simply want to list them on the same line, we can provide a single string to the document, e.g., --- title: &quot;Untitled&quot; author: &quot;John Doe, Jane Doe&quot; --- Alternatively, if we wish each entry to be on its own line, we can provide a list of entries to the YAML field. This can be useful if you wish to include further information about each author such as an email address or institution, e.g., --- author: - John Doe, Institution One - Jane Doe, Institution Two --- We can make use of the Markdown syntax ^[] to add additional information as a footnote to the document. This may be more useful if you have extended information that you wish to include for each author, such as providing a contact Email and address. The exact behavior will depend on the output format: --- author: - John Doe^[Institution One, john@example.org] - Jane Doe^[Institution Two, jane@example.org] --- Certain R Markdown templates will allow you to specify additional parameters directly within the YAML. For example, the Distill output format allows url, affiliation, and affiliation_url to be specified. After you install the distill package (Dervieux et al. 2023): install.packages(&quot;distill&quot;) you can use the Distill format with detailed author information, e.g., --- title: &quot;Distill for R Markdown&quot; author: - name: &quot;JJ Allaire&quot; url: https://github.com/jjallaire affiliation: RStudio affiliation_url: https://www.rstudio.com output: distill::distill_article --- References "],["figure-number.html", "4.10 Numbered figure captions", " 4.10 Numbered figure captions We can use bookdown (Xie 2025b) output formats to add figure numbers to their captions.

Besides html_document2, there are several other similar functions for other output formats, such as pdf_document2 and word_document2. You can add this feature to R Markdown output formats outside bookdown, too. The key is to use those formats as the “base formats” of bookdown output formats. For example, to number and cross-reference figures in the rticles::jss_article format, you can use: output: bookdown::pdf_book: base_format: rticles::jss_article Please read the help pages of the bookdown output format functions to see if they have the base_format argument (e.g., ?bookdown::html_document2). References "],["combine-words.html", "4.11 Combine words into a comma-separated phrase", " 4.11 Combine words into a comma-separated phrase When you want to output a character vector for humans to read (e.g., x &lt;- c(\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")), you probably do not want something like [1] \"apple\" \"banana\" \"cherry\", which is the normal way to print a vector in R. Instead, you may want a character string “apple, banana, and cherry”. There is a base R function, paste(), that you can use to concatenate a character vector into a single string, e.g., paste(x, collapse = ', '), and the output will be \"apple, banana, cherry\". The problems are (1) the conjunction “and” is missing, and (2) when the vector only contains two elements, we should not use commas (e.g., the output should be \"apple and banana\" instead of \"apple, banana\"). The function knitr::combine_words() can be used to concatenate words into a phrase regardless of the length of the character vector. Basically, for a single word, it will just return this word; for two words A and B, it returns \"A and B\"; for three or more words, it returns \"A, B, C, ..., Y, and Z\". The function also has a few arguments that can customize the output. For example, if you want to output the words in pairs of backticks, you may use knitr::combine_words(x, before = '`'). Below are more examples with different arguments, and please see the help page ?knitr::combine_words if the meaning of any argument is not clear from the output here: v &lt;- c(&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;) knitr::combine_words(v) ## apple, banana, and cherry knitr::combine_words(v, before = &quot;`&quot;, after = &quot;&#39;&quot;) ## `apple&#39;, `banana&#39;, and `cherry&#39; knitr::combine_words(v, and = &quot;&quot;) ## apple, banana, cherry knitr::combine_words(v, sep = &quot; / &quot;, and = &quot;&quot;) ## apple / banana / cherry knitr::combine_words(v[1]) # a single word ## apple knitr::combine_words(v[1:2]) # two words ## apple and banana knitr::combine_words(LETTERS[1:5]) ## A, B, C, D, and E This function can be particularly handy when it is used in an inline R expression, e.g., This morning we had `r knitr::combine_words(v)` for breakfast. "],["linebreaks.html", "4.12 Preserve a large number of line breaks", " 4.12 Preserve a large number of line breaks Markdown users may be surprised to realize that whitespaces (including line breaks) are usually meaningless unless they are used in a verbatim environment (code blocks). Two or more spaces are the same as one space, and a line break is the same as a space. If you have used LaTeX or HTML before, you may not be surprised because the rule is the same in these languages. In Markdown, we often use a blank line to separate elements such as paragraphs. To break a line without introducing a new paragraph, you have to use two trailing spaces. Sometimes you may want to break the lines many times, especially when you write or quote poems or lyrics. Adding two spaces after each line manually is a tedious task. The function blogdown:::quote_poem() can do this task automatically, e.g., blogdown:::quote_poem(c(&quot;This line&quot;, &quot;should be&quot;, &quot;broken.&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;&gt; This line \\n&gt; should be \\n&gt; broken.&quot; If you use the RStudio IDE and have installed the package blogdown (Xie, Dervieux, and Presmanes Hill 2026), you can select the text in which you want to preserve the line breaks, and click the RStudio addin “Quote Poem” in the drop-down menu “Addins” on the toolbar.

Figure 4.3 shows a simple “Pac-man” animation created from the code chunk below: ```{r, animation.hook=&quot;gifski&quot;} for (i in 1:2) { pie(c(i %% 2, 6), col = c(&#39;red&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;), labels = NA) } ``` FIGURE 4.3: A Pac-man animation. The image format of the animation is GIF, which works well for HTML output, but it is not straightforward to support GIF in LaTeX. That is why you only see two static image frames in Figure 4.3 if you are reading the PDF or printed version of this book. If you read the online version of this book, you will see the actual animation. Animations can work in PDF, but there are two prerequisites. First, you have to load the LaTeX package animate (see Section 6.4 for how). Second, you can only use Acrobat Reader to view the animation. Then the chunk option fig.show = \"animate\" will use the animate package to create the animation.

By default, interval = 1 (i.e., one second). The R package animation (Xie 2025a) contains several animation examples to illustrate methods and ideas in statistical computing. The gganimate package (Pedersen and Robinson 2025) allows us to create smooth animations based on ggplot2 (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2025). Both packages work with R Markdown.

We will present a Graphviz example in this section,6 but you can also use pure R code to create graphs and diagrams with DiagrammeR.

If you specify a substitution with @@, you must ensure there is a valid R expression for that substitution. The expressions are placed as footnotes and their evaluations must result in an R vector object. The @@ notation is immediately followed by a number, and that number should correspond to the number of the R expression footnote. Figure 4.5 shows an example of embedding and evaluating R code in the diagram.

If you want these characters verbatim, you have to escape them. For example, a pair of underscores surrounding text usually makes the text italic. You need to escape the underscores if you want verbatim underscores instead of italic text. The way to escape a special character is to add a backslash before it, e.g., I do not want \\_italic text\\_ here. Similarly, if # does not indicate a section heading, you may write \\# This is not a heading. As mentioned in Section 4.12, a sequence of whitespaces will be rendered as a single regular space. If you want to render the sequence of spaces literally, you need to escape each of them, e.g., keep the social \\ \\ \\ distance.

For this purpose, you can set the chunk option echo = FALSE to hide the source code instead, so readers will not be distracted by the program code for computing. However, the source code is still important for the sake of reproducible research. Sometimes readers may want to verify the computational correctness after they have finished reading the report. In this case, it can be a good idea to hold all code blocks in the body of the report, and display them at the end of a document (e.g., in an appendix). There is a simple method of extracting all code chunks in a document and putting them together in a single code chunk using the chunk option ref.label and the function knitr::all_labels(), e.g., # Appendix: All code for this report ```{r ref.label=knitr::all_labels(), echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE} ``` Please read Section 14.1.3 if you are not familiar with the chunk option ref.label. The function knitr::all_labels() returns a vector of all chunk labels in the document, so ref.label = knitr::all_labels() means retrieving all source code chunks to this code chunk. With the chunk options echo = TRUE (display the code) and eval = FALSE (do not evaluate this particular code chunk because all code has been executed before), you can show a copy of all your source code in one code chunk. Since ref.label can be a character vector of arbitrary chunk labels, you can certainly filter the labels to decide a subset of code chunks to display in the code appendix. Below is an example (credits to Ariel Muldoon) of excluding the labels setup and get-labels: ```{r get-labels, echo = FALSE} labs = knitr::all_labels() labs = setdiff(labs, c(&quot;setup&quot;, &quot;get-labels&quot;)) ``` ```{r all-code, ref.label=labs, eval=FALSE} ``` You can also filter code chunks using the arguments of knitr::all_labels(). For example, you may use knitr::all_labels(engine == \"Rcpp\", echo == FALSE) to obtain all your code chunks that use the Rcpp engine (engine == \"Rcpp\") and are not displayed in the document (echo = FALSE). If you want precise control over which code chunks to display in the appendix, you may use a special chunk option appendix = TRUE on certain code chunks, and ref.label = knitr::all_labels(appendix == TRUE) to obtain the labels of these code chunks. "],["lua-filters.html", "4.20 Manipulate Markdown via Pandoc Lua filters (*)", " 4.20 Manipulate Markdown via Pandoc Lua filters (*) Technically, this section may be a little advanced, but once you learn how your Markdown content is translated into the Pandoc abstract syntax tree (AST), you will have the power of manipulating any Markdown elements with the programming language called Lua. Basically, when Pandoc reads a Markdown file, the content will be parsed into an AST. Pandoc allows you to modify this AST with Lua scripts. We use the following simple Markdown file (named ast.md) to show what the AST means: ## Section One Hello world! This file contains a header and a paragraph. After Pandoc parses this content, it may be easier for R users to understand the resulting AST if we convert the file to the JSON format: pandoc -f markdown -t json -o ast.json ast.md Then read the JSON file into R, and print out the data structure. When you do this, you will see that the Markdown content is represented in a recursive list. Its structure is printed below. The label t stands for “type,” and c stands for “content.” Take the header for example. Its type is “Header”, and its content has three sub-elements: the header level (2), the attributes (e.g., the ID is section-one), and the text content. xfun:::tree( jsonlite::fromJSON(&#39;ast.json&#39;, simplifyVector = FALSE) ) List of 3 |-pandoc-api-version:List of 3 | |-: int 1 | |-: int 22 | |-: int 1 |-meta : Named list() |-blocks :List of 2 |-:List of 2 | |-t: chr &quot;Header&quot; | |-c:List of 3 | |-: int 2 | |-:List of 3 | | |-: chr &quot;section-one&quot; | | |-: list() | | |-: list() | |-:List of 3 | |-:List of 2 | | |-t: chr &quot;Str&quot; | | |-c: chr &quot;Section&quot; | |-:List of 1 | | |-t: chr &quot;Space&quot; | |-:List of 2 | |-t: chr &quot;Str&quot; | |-c: chr &quot;One&quot; |-:List of 2 |-t: chr &quot;Para&quot; |-c:List of 3 |-:List of 2 | |-t: chr &quot;Str&quot; | |-c: chr &quot;Hello&quot; |-:List of 1 | |-t: chr &quot;Space&quot; |-:List of 2 |-t: chr &quot;Str&quot; |-c: chr &quot;world!&quot; After you are aware of the AST, you can modify it with the Lua programming language. Pandoc has a built-in Lua interpreter, so you do not need to install additional tools. The Lua scripts are called “Lua filters” for Pandoc. Next we give a quick example of raising the levels of headers by one, e.g., convert level 3 headers to level 2 headers. This may be useful when the top-level headers of your document are level 2 headers, but you want to start with level 1 headers instead. First, we create a Lua script file named raise-header.lua, which contains a function named Header, indicating that we want to modify elements of the type “Header” (in general, you can use the type name as the function name to process elements of a certain type): function Header(el) -- The header level can be accessed via the attribute &#39;level&#39; -- of the element. See the Pandoc documentation later. if (el.level &lt;= 1) then error(&quot;I don&#39;t know how to raise the level of h1&quot;) end el.level = el.level - 1 return el end Then we can pass this script to Pandoc via the argument --lua-filter, e.g., pandoc -t markdown --markdown-headings=atx \\ --lua-filter=raise-header.lua ast.md # Section One Hello world! You can see that we have successfully converted ## Section One to # Section One. You may feel this example is trivial, and wonder why not simply replace ## with # with a regular expression like: gsub(&quot;^##&quot;, &quot;#&quot;, readLines(&quot;ast.md&quot;)) Usually it is not robust to manipulate a structured document with regular expressions, because there are almost always exceptions, e.g., what if ## means a comment in R code? The AST gives you the structured data, so you know for sure that you are modifying the expected elements. Pandoc has extensive documentation on Lua filters at https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html, where you can find a large number of examples. You can also find some filters written by the community in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/pandoc/lua-filters. In the R Markdown world, below is an incomplete list of packages that have made use of Lua filters (usually they are in the inst/ directory): The rmarkdown package (https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown) contains filters that insert page breaks (see Section 4.1) and generate custom blocks (see Section 9.6). The pagedown package (Xie, Lesur, et al. 2025) contains filters that help implement footnotes and the list of figures on HTML pages. The govdown package (Garmonsway 2021) contains filters to convert Pandoc’s fenced Divs to appropriate HTML tags. You can also find an example in Section 5.1.2 in this book, which shows you how to change the text color with a Lua filter. For R Markdown users who do not want to create R packages to ship the Lua filters (like the above packages), you may store these Lua scripts anywhere on your computer, and apply them through the pandoc_args option of an R Markdown output format, e.g., --- output: html_document: pandoc_args: - --lua-filter=raise-header.lua --- References "],["formatting.html", "Chapter 5 Formatting", " Chapter 5 Formatting The greatest strength of the Markdown language is that its simplicity makes it very easy to read and write even to newcomers. This is its key design principle, as outlined by the creator of the original Markdown language: A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. — John Gruber However, this comes at a cost of customization. Many features of typical word processors are not directly available in Markdown, e.g., changing the font size of a piece of text; changing the font color of certain words; specifying text alignment. We leave it to you to decide whether such features are worth your effort. To some degree, Markdown reflects the philosophy of Stoicism: the “natural world” consists of plain text, and you should not be controlled by the desire for (visual) pleasure. Anyway, this chapter offers some tips on how you can customize the appearance and styling of elements in an R Markdown document. If you need a reminder in the basics of the Markdown language, the R Markdown cheatsheet at https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/ provides a good overview of the basic syntax. "],["font-color.html", "5.1 Font color", " 5.1 Font color The Markdown syntax has no built-in method for changing text colors. We can use HTML and LaTeX syntax to change the formatting of words: For HTML, we can wrap the text in the &lt;span&gt; tag and set color with CSS, e.g., &lt;span style=\"color: red;\"&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;. For PDF, we can use the LaTeX command \\textcolor{}{}. This requires the LaTeX package xcolor, which is included in Pandoc’s default LaTeX template. As an example of changing the color in PDF text: --- output: pdf_document --- Roses are \\textcolor{red}{red}, violets are \\textcolor{blue}{blue}. In the above example, the first set of curly braces contains the desired text color, and the second set of curly braces contains the text to which this color should be applied. If you want to design an R Markdown document for multiple output formats, you should not embed raw HTML or LaTeX code in your document, because they will be ignored in the other output formats (e.g., LaTeX code will be ignored in HTML output, and HTML tags will be lost in LaTeX output). Next, we provide two possible methods to deal with this issue. 5.1.1 Using an R function to write raw HTML or LaTeX code We can write a custom R function to insert the correct syntax depending on the output format using the is_latex_output() and is_html_output() functions in knitr as follows: colorize &lt;- function(x, color) { if (knitr::is_latex_output()) { sprintf(&quot;\\\\textcolor{%s}{%s}&quot;, color, x) } else if (knitr::is_html_output()) { sprintf(&quot;&lt;span style=&#39;color: %s;&#39;&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, color, x) } else x } We can then use the code in an inline R expression `r colorize(\"some words in red\", \"red\")`, which will create some words in red (you will not see the red color if you are reading this book printed in black and white). 5.1.2 Using a Pandoc Lua filter (*) This method may be a little advanced for R users because it involves another programming language, Lua, but it is extremely powerful—you can programmatically modify Markdown elements via Pandoc’s Lua filters (see Section 4.20). Below is a full example: --- title: &quot;Color text with a Lua filter&quot; output: html_document: pandoc_args: [&quot;--lua-filter=color-text.lua&quot;] pdf_document: pandoc_args: [&quot;--lua-filter=color-text.lua&quot;] keep_tex: true --- First, we define a Lua filter and write it to the file `color-text.lua`. ```{cat, engine.opts = list(file = &quot;color-text.lua&quot;)} Span = function(el) color = el.attributes[&#39;color&#39;] -- if no color attribute, return unchange if color == nil then return el end -- transform to &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; if FORMAT:match &#39;html&#39; then -- remove color attributes el.attributes[&#39;color&#39;] = nil -- use style attribute instead el.attributes[&#39;style&#39;] = &#39;color: &#39; .. color .. &#39;;&#39; -- return full span element return el elseif FORMAT:match &#39;latex&#39; then -- remove color attributes el.attributes[&#39;color&#39;] = nil -- encapsulate in latex code table.insert( el.content, 1, pandoc.RawInline(&#39;latex&#39;, &#39;\\\\textcolor{&#39;..color..&#39;}{&#39;) ) table.insert( el.content, pandoc.RawInline(&#39;latex&#39;, &#39;}&#39;) ) -- returns only span content return el.content else -- for other format return unchanged return el end end ``` Now we can test the filter with some text in brackets with the `color` attribute, e.g., &gt; Roses are [red and **bold**]{color=&quot;red&quot;} and &gt; violets are [blue]{color=&quot;blue&quot;}. In this example, we implicitly used a Pandoc Markdown extension named bracketed_spans, which allows us to write text with attributes, e.g., [text]{.class attribute=\"value\"}. The Lua filter defined in the cat code chunk7 puts text in &lt;span style=\"color: ...\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; if the output format is HTML, and in \\textcolor{...}{} if the output format is LaTeX. The Lua filter is written to a file color-text.lua, and enabled through the command-line option --lua-filter passed to Pandoc via the pandoc_args option of the output formats. Compared to the previous method, the advantage of using the Lua filter is that you can still use Markdown syntax inside the brackets, whereas using the R function colorize() in the previous section does not allow Markdown syntax (e.g., colorize('**bold**') will not be bold). If you are not familiar with cat code chunks, please see Section 15.6. We used this engine here to conveniently write out a chunk to a .lua file, so we do not have to manage the Lua script in a separate file color-text.lua. If you do not want to use the cat engine, you can definitely copy the Lua code and save it to a separate file, instead of embedding the Lua code in a code chunk.↩︎ "],["indent-text.html", "5.2 Indent text", " 5.2 Indent text As mentioned in Section 4.12, whitespaces are often meaningless in Markdown. Markdown will also ignore spaces used for indentation by default. However, we may want to keep the indentation in certain cases, e.g., in verses and addresses. In these situations, we can use line blocks by starting the line with a vertical bar (|). The line breaks and any leading spaces will be preserved in the output. For example:8 | When dollars appear it&#39;s a sign | that your code does not quite align | Ensure that your math | in xaringan hath | been placed on a single long line The output is: When dollars appear it’s a sign   that your code does not quite align Ensure that your math   in xaringan hath   been placed on a single long line The lines can be hard-wrapped in the Markdown source. If the continuation line begins with a space, the previous line break and the leading spaces on this line will be ignored as usual. For example: | Hiring Manager | School of Ninja, Hacker&#39;s University | 404 Not Found Road, Undefined 0x1234, NA The output is: Hiring Manager School of Ninja, Hacker’s University 404 Not Found Road, Undefined 0x1234, NA You can see that the line break after “School of Ninja” was ignored. This is a limerick written by Claus Ekstrøm: https://yihui.org/en/2018/06/xaringan-math-limerick/.↩︎ "],["text-width.html", "5.3 Control the width of text output", " 5.3 Control the width of text output Sometimes the text output printed from R code may be too wide. If the output document has a fixed page width (e.g., PDF documents), the text output may exceed the page margins. See Figure 5.1 for an example. The R global option width can be used to control the width of printed text output from some R functions, and you may try a smaller value if the default is too large. This option typically indicates a rough number of characters per line (except for East Asian languages). For example: The output is too wide in this chunk: ```{r} options(width = 300) matrix(runif(100), ncol = 20) ``` The output of this chunk looks better: ```{r} options(width = 60) matrix(runif(100), ncol = 20) ``` Not all R functions respect the width option. If this option does not work, your only choice may be to wrap the long lines of text. This is actually the default behavior of the html_document output format. If the HTML output format that you are using does not wrap the long lines, you may apply the CSS code below (see Section 7.1 for instructions): pre code { white-space: pre-wrap; } For PDF output, it is trickier to wrap the lines. One solution is to use the LaTeX package listings, which can be enabled via the Pandoc argument --listings. Then you have to set an option for this package, and the setup code can be included from an external LaTeX file (see Section 6.1 for how), e.g., --- output: pdf_document: pandoc_args: --listings includes: in_header: preamble.tex --- In preamble.tex, we set an option of the listings package: \\lstset{ breaklines=true } If you do not like the appearance of code blocks with listings, you can set up other listings options in \\lstset{}, e.g., you may change the font family with basicstyle=\\ttfamily. You can find more information about this package in its documentation: https://ctan.org/pkg/listings. Figure 5.1 shows the default pdf_document output that contains wide text, which exceeds the page margin. Figure 5.2 shows the PDF output when we use the listings package to wrap the text. FIGURE 5.1: Normal text output that is too wide. FIGURE 5.2: Text output wrapped with the listings package. "],["figure-size.html", "5.4 Control the size of plots/images", " 5.4 Control the size of plots/images The size of plots made in R can be controlled by the chunk option fig.width and fig.height (in inches). Equivalently, you can use the fig.dim option to specify the width and height in a numeric vector of length 2, e.g., fig.dim = c(8, 6) means fig.width = 8 and fig.height = 6. These options set the physical size of plots, and you can choose to display a different size in the output using chunk options out.width and out.height, e.g., out.width = \"50%\". If a plot or an image is not generated from an R code chunk, you can include it in two ways: Use the Markdown syntax ![caption](path/to/image). In this case, you can set the size of the image using the width and/or height attributes, e.g., We include an image in the next paragraph: ![A nice image.](foo/bar.png){width=50%} Use the knitr function knitr::include_graphics() in a code chunk. You can use chunk options such as out.width and out.height for this chunk, e.g., We include an external image with the R function: ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=&quot;50%&quot;, fig.cap=&quot;A nice image.&quot;} knitr::include_graphics(&quot;foo/bar.png&quot;) ``` We used the width 50% in the above examples, which means half of the width of the image container (if the image is directly contained by a page instead of a child element of the page, that means half of the page width). If you know that you only want to generate the image for a specific output format, you can use a specific unit. For example, you may use 300px if the output format is HTML. "],["fig-align.html", "5.5 Figure alignment", " 5.5 Figure alignment The chunk option fig.align specifies the alignment of figures. For example, you can center images with fig.align = 'center', or right-align images with fig.align = 'right'. This option works for both HTML and LaTeX output, but may not work for other output formats (such as Word, unfortunately). It works for both plots drawn from R code chunks and external images included via knitr::include_graphics(). "],["verbatim-code-chunks.html", "5.6 Verbatim code chunks", " 5.6 Verbatim code chunks Typically we write code chunks and inline expressions that we want to be parsed and evaluated by knitr. However, if you are trying to write a tutorial on using knitr, you may need to generate a verbatim code chunk or inline expression that is not parsed by knitr, and we want to display the content of the chunk header. The verbatim engine can take any R Markdown content and output it as-is in the resulting document. By using more backticks on the outer fences than the backticks in the inner content, a whole code chunk including the chunk header can be included in a verbatim chunk. For example, ````{verbatim} ```{r, eval=TRUE} 1 + 1 ``` ```` will be rendered as: ```{r, eval=TRUE} 1 + 1 ``` in the output. You have to use at least N+1 backticks to wrap up N backticks. We are using four backticks here for the verbatim chunk because the inner chunk header contains three backticks. The content of the verbatim chunk will be placed in a fenced code block with the class default, meaning no syntax highlighting will be applied. You can set the lang chunk option to use a different syntax highlighting language name. For example, ````{verbatim, lang = &quot;markdown&quot;} We can output arbitrary content **verbatim**. ```{r} 1 + 1 ``` The content can contain inline code like `r pi * 5^2`, too. ```` will result in the Markdown source file as ````markdown We can output arbitrary content **verbatim**. ```{r} 1 + 1 ``` The content can contain inline code like `r pi * 5^2`, too. ```` The verbatim content will be syntax highlighted using the markdown language in the output. If the content you want to include verbatim is in a file, you can use the embed engine instead. Here is an example of the CSS code from Section 9.6.2: .blackbox { padding: 1em; background: black; color: white; border: 2px solid orange; border-radius: 10px; } .center { text-align: center; } The syntax for the above inclusion in our Rmd source file is ```{embed, file = &quot;css/box.css&quot;} ``` Another syntax for it is to pass the file as chunk body: ```{embed} &quot;css/box.css&quot; ``` The embed engine is based on the verbatim engine. By default, the lang option is set based on the extension of the file you include. It can be modified using lang directly as chunk option. 5.6.1 Show a verbatim inline expression There are multiple ways to show a verbatim inline expression. The first way is to break the inline expression after `r, e.g., This will show a verbatim inline R expression `` `r 1+1` `` in the output. In the output document, you should see: This will show a verbatim inline R expression `r 1+1` in the output. The trick works for two reasons: (1) a single line break is often the same as a space to Markdown parsers (by comparison, two consecutive line breaks means starting a new paragraph); (2) knitr requires a space after `r to parse it; if the space is missing, it will not be treated as an inline expression. Another way to show a verbatim inline R expression is to wrap the R code in knitr::inline_expr(), e.g., This will show a verbatim inline R expression `` `r knitr::inline_expr(&quot;1+1&quot;)` `` in the output. I’d recommend the second way, because the first way is more or less a hack taking advantage of the Markdown syntax and knitr’s parser. "],["number-lines.html", "5.7 Line numbers for code blocks (*)", " 5.7 Line numbers for code blocks (*) You can add line numbers to either source code blocks, via the chunk option attr.source = \".numberLines\", or text output blocks, via attr.output = \".numberLines\" (see Section 11.13 for more information on these options), e.g., ```{r, attr.source=&#39;.numberLines&#39;} if (TRUE) { x &lt;- 1:10 x + 1 } ``` The output is: if (TRUE) { x &lt;- 1:10 x + 1 } Note that for HTML output, you have to choose a syntax highlighting theme provided by Pandoc, which means the highlight option of the output format should not be default or textmate. You can use other values for this option listed on the help page ?rmarkdown::html_document, e.g., output: html_document: highlight: tango For bookdown’s gitbook output format, you may need to adjust the CSS a little bit for the line numbers to be displayed properly on the left side of the code. Below is what we used for this book (if you find the line numbers too close to the left margin, increase the left value to, say, -0.2em): pre.numberSource code &gt; span &gt; a:first-child::before { left: -0.3em; } For revealjs’s revealjs_presentation output format (Allaire and El Hattab 2025), you may also need to adjust the CSS. .reveal pre code { overflow: visible; } See Section 7.1 if you do not know how to apply custom CSS styles to HTML output. You can also specify the starting number via the startFrom attribute, e.g., ```{r, attr.source=&#39;.numberLines startFrom=&quot;5&quot;&#39;} if (TRUE) { 1:10 } ``` Line numbers are not supported for Word output at the moment. References "],["multi-column.html", "5.8 Multi-column layout (*)", " 5.8 Multi-column layout (*) Pandoc’s Markdown supports the multi-column layout for slides but not other types of documents. In this recipe, we show how to use the multi-column layout in normal HTML documents and LaTeX documents. This recipe was inspired by Atsushi Yasumoto’s solutions to the knitr issue https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1743. The recipe will be much simpler if you only need to consider HTML output, because arranging HTML elements side by side is relatively simple via CSS. It will be even simpler if you only need to arrange the text output of a code chunk side by side. Below is the first example: --- output: html_document --- ```{r attr.source=&quot;style=&#39;display:inline-block;&#39;&quot;, collapse=TRUE} 1:10 # a sequence from 1 to 10 10:1 # in the reverse order ``` The CSS attribute display: inline-block; means the output code blocks (i.e., the &lt;pre&gt; tags in HTML) should be displayed as inline elements. By default, these blocks are displayed as block-level elements (i.e., display: block;) and will occupy whole rows. The chunk option collapse = TRUE means the text output will be merged into the R source code block, so both the source and its text output will be placed in the same &lt;pre&gt; block. If you want to arrange arbitrary content side by side in HTML output, you can use Pandoc’s fenced Div. The name “Div” comes from the HTML tag &lt;div&gt;, but you can interpret it as an arbitrary block or container. A Div starts and ends with three or more colons (e.g., :::). A Div with more colons can contain Divs with fewer colons. An important and useful feature of the fenced Div is that you can attach attributes to it. For example, you can apply the CSS attribute display: flex; to an outside container, so that the inside containers will be placed side by side: --- output: html_document --- :::: {style=&quot;display: flex;&quot;} ::: {} Here is the **first** Div. ```{r} str(iris) ``` ::: ::: {} And this block will be put on the right: ```{r} plot(iris[, -5]) ``` ::: :::: In the above example, the outside Div (::::) contains two Divs (:::). You can certainly add more Divs inside. To learn more about the very powerful CSS attribute display: flex; (CSS Flexbox), you may read the guide at https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/. The CSS Grid (display: grid;) is also very powerful and can be used in the above example, too. If you want to try it, you may change display: flex; to display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;. See the guide at https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/ if you want to learn more about the grid layout. It is trickier if you want the layout to work for both HTML and LaTeX output. We show a full example below that works for HTML documents, LaTeX documents, and Beamer presentations: --- output: html_document: css: columns.css pdf_document: keep_tex: true includes: in_header: columns.tex beamer_presentation: keep_tex: true includes: in_header: columns.tex --- # Two columns Below is a Div containing three child Divs side by side. The Div in the middle is empty, just to add more space between the left and right Divs. :::::: {.cols data-latex=&quot;&quot;} ::: {.col data-latex=&quot;{0.55\\textwidth}&quot;} ```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4} par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .1)) plot(cars, pch = 19) ``` ::: ::: {.col data-latex=&quot;{0.05\\textwidth}&quot;} \\ &lt;!-- an empty Div (with a white space), serving as a column separator --&gt; ::: ::: {.col data-latex=&quot;{0.4\\textwidth}&quot;} The figure on the left-hand side shows the `cars` data.

Figure 5.3 shows the output. In this example, we used an outside Div with the class .cols and three inside Divs with the class .col. For HTML output, we introduced an external CSS file columns.css, in which we applied the Flexbox layout to the outside Div so the inside Divs can be placed side by side: .cols {display: flex; } For LaTeX output (pdf_document), we have to introduce some dirty hacks stored in columns.tex to the LaTeX preamble to define the LaTeX environments cols and col: \\newenvironment{cols}[1][]{}{} \\newenvironment{col}[1]{\\begin{minipage}{#1}\\ignorespaces}{% \\end{minipage} \\ifhmode\\unskip\\fi \\aftergroup\\useignorespacesandallpars} \\def\\useignorespacesandallpars#1\\ignorespaces\\fi{% #1\\fi\\ignorespacesandallpars} \\makeatletter \\def\\ignorespacesandallpars{% \\@ifnextchar\\par {\\expandafter\\ignorespacesandallpars\\@gobble}% {}% } \\makeatother The col environment is particularly complicated mainly because Pandoc starts a new paragraph for each Div in LaTeX output, and we have to remove these new paragraphs. Otherwise, the Divs cannot be placed side by side. The hacks were borrowed from https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/179016/9128. For Beamer output, we apply the same hacks in columns.tex. Please note that Pandoc has provided some special Div’s for slide shows, such as ::: {.columns}, ::: {.column}, and ::: {.incremental}. Because they already have their special meanings, you must be careful not to use these types of Div’s if you intend to convert a Div to a LaTeX environment in the way mentioned in this section. That is why we did not use the Div types columns or column, but chose to use cols and col instead. For more information about fenced Div’s, please refer to Section 9.6. "],["latex-output.html", "Chapter 6 LaTeX Output", " Chapter 6 LaTeX Output For many authors, the main output of their work will be the PDF report, in which case they can utilize the powerful styling of LaTeX. In this chapter, we discuss approaches that can be used to customize PDF reports, such as including LaTeX code or packages in the preamble, using custom LaTeX templates, adding headers and footers, generating sub-figures, and writing raw LaTeX code in the document body. We want to offer a note of caution before we start, however. One benefit of R Markdown is the fact that a single source document can create documents with multiple formats. By tailoring your work to a single output format, you may improve the appearance and performance of a single output format, but at the expense of this transferability. This problem is not unique to LaTeX, but all other output formats as well. "],["latex-preamble.html", "6.1 Add LaTeX code to the preamble", " 6.1 Add LaTeX code to the preamble The general structure of a LaTeX document is like this: \\documentclass{article} % preamble \\begin{document} % body \\end{document} That is, you declare the document class in \\documentclass{}, load certain LaTeX packages and set certain options if necessary in the preamble, and start writing the body of your document after \\begin{document}. A Markdown document is mostly the body of the document. If you want to add anything to the preamble, you have to use the includes option of pdf_document. This option has three sub-options: in_header, before_body, and after_body. Each of them takes one or multiple file paths. The file(s) specified in in_header will be added to the preamble. The files specified in before_body and after_body are added before and after the document body, respectively. For example, below is a trick that turns hyperlinks in text into footnotes. This trick is useful when the PDF output document is printed on paper, because readers will not be able to click the links (generated from \\href{URL}{text}) on paper but can see the URLs in footnotes. This trick displays both the text and URL. % you may want to save a copy of \\href before redefining it % \\let\\oldhref\\href \\renewcommand{\\href}[2]{#2\\footnote{\\url{#1}}} You can save the above code in a file with an arbitrary filename, e.g., preamble.tex. Then include it in the preamble through: output: pdf_document: includes: in_header: &quot;preamble.tex&quot; For this particular trick, you do not really have to implement it by yourself, but can simply set the YAML option links-as-notes to true because it is a built-in feature of Pandoc’s default LaTeX template (see Section 6.2). Another way to add code to the preamble is to pass it directly to the header-includes field in the YAML frontmatter. We will show an example in Section 6.3. The advantage of using header-includes is that you can keep everything in one R Markdown document. However, if your report is to be generated in multiple output formats, we still recommend that you use the includes method, because the header-includes field is unconditional, and will be included in non-LaTeX output documents, too. By comparison, the includes option is only applied to the pdf_document format. "],["latex-variables.html", "6.2 Pandoc options for LaTeX output", " 6.2 Pandoc options for LaTeX output If you are using the default Pandoc template for LaTeX output, there are several options that you may set to adjust the appearance of the PDF output document. We list a few example options below, and you may see https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex for a full list. documentclass: book classoption: - twocolumn - landscape papersize: a5 linestretch: 1.5 fontsize: 12pt links-as-notes: true The meanings of these options should be clear if you have some knowledge about LaTeX. The documentclass option sets the document class, e.g., article, book, and report, etc. The classoption is a list of options to be passed to the document class, e.g., you can create a two-column document with the twocolumn option,9 or the landscape layout with the landscape option (the default is the portrait layout). The papersize option sets the paper size, e.g., a4, paper, or a5. The linestretch option sets the line spacing. The fontsize option sets the font size, e.g., 10pt, 11pt, or 12pt. The links-as-notes option turns links in text to footnotes, which is useful when the PDF is printed on paper, because readers will not be able to click the links on paper but can see the URLs in footnotes. Changing fonts can be a little trickier. It depends on which LaTeX engine you are using. If you are using pdflatex, which is usually the default engine for most LaTeX-based output formats, you may use the fontfamily option to select a LaTeX font package to be loaded in your document to change the font, e.g., fontfamily: accanthis output: pdf_document: latex_engine: pdflatex Then the document will use the font Accanthis. You may see https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/ for a list of many other LaTeX font packages. If your LaTeX distribution is TinyTeX and the required font packages have not been installed, they should be automatically installed when the document is compiled (see Section 1.2). If you use the LaTeX engine xelatex or lualatex, you will be able to select fonts that are available on your local computer, and do not have to install additional LaTeX packages. YAML options like mainfont, sansfont, and monofont can be used to specify the main font, sans serif font, and typewriter font, respectively, e.g., mainfont: Arial output: pdf_document: latex_engine: xelatex You can also use some of those LaTeX options when you generate Beamer slides, because a Beamer document is a LaTeX document, too. In addition, Pandoc has provided a few more options for Beamer slides, which can be found at https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-beamer-slides. For example, you can specify the author affiliation via the institute option: --- output: beamer_presentation institute: &quot;University of Hackers&quot; --- This option changes the layout of the whole document, but if you want to switch back to the one-column mode from a certain point, you may insert a command \\onecolumn at that point.

"],["latex-extra.html", "6.4 Include additional LaTeX packages", " 6.4 Include additional LaTeX packages The use of additional LaTeX packages can allow for extensive customization of document styling. In addition, several packages such as kableExtra (Zhu 2024) may have LaTeX dependencies for the R package to function. Much like R, we need to load packages within the R Markdown document before we are able to use their functions. 6.4.1 Loading LaTeX packages We can load additional LaTeX packages using the extra_dependencies option within the pdf_document YAML settings. This allows us to provide a list of LaTeX packages to be loaded in the intermediate LaTeX output document, e.g., --- title: &quot;Using more LaTeX packages&quot; output: pdf_document: extra_dependencies: [&quot;bbm&quot;, &quot;threeparttable&quot;] --- If you need to specify options when loading the package, you can add a second level to the list and provide the options as a list, e.g., output: pdf_document: extra_dependencies: caption: [&quot;labelfont={bf}&quot;] hyperref: [&quot;unicode=true&quot;, &quot;breaklinks=true&quot;] lmodern: null For those familiar with LaTeX, this is equivalent to the following LaTeX code: \\usepackage[labelfont={bf}]{caption} \\usepackage[unicode=true, breaklinks=true]{hyperref} \\usepackage{lmodern} The advantage of using the extra_dependencies argument over the includes argument introduced in Section 6.1 is that you do not need to include an external file, so your Rmd document can be self-contained. 6.4.2 Example packages There is an extensive community for LaTeX, and there are over 4,000 packages available through the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN). Here are some examples of LaTeX packages you could consider using within your report: pdfpages: Include full PDF pages from an external PDF document within your document. caption: Change the appearance of caption subtitles.

References "],["figure-placement.html", "6.5 Control the placement of figures", " 6.5 Control the placement of figures One common frustration with LaTeX is the placement of figures and tables. Unlike in a word processor like Microsoft Word, in which figures are placed directly where the user specifies, LaTeX will attempt to place a figure in a position that does not violate certain typographic rules. In doing so, figures may float away from where they are referenced in the text. This section will explain some background information on how floating environments (such as figures) work and provide several options for customizing their behavior. 6.5.1 Floating environments By default, figures with captions are generated with the figure environment in LaTeX. For example, Pandoc will convert the following Markdown code that contains an image ![This is a figure.](images/cool.jpg) to the LaTeX code: \\begin{figure} \\includegraphics{images/cool.jpg} \\caption{This is a figure.} \\end{figure} The figure environment is a floating environment. You can read a detailed description of floats at https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions. In summary, floats are used as containers for things that cannot be broken over a page, such as tables and figures. If the figure or table cannot be contained in the space left on the current page, LaTeX will try to place it at the top of the next page. If the figure is tall enough, it may occupy the whole next page, even if there is still space left for a few lines of text. The behavior can be controlled by different placement specifiers in square brackets after \\begin{figure}, e.g., \\begin{figure}[b]. Below is a list of possible specifiers: h: Place the float here, i.e., approximately at the same point it occurs in the source text. t: Position at the top of the page. b: Position at the bottom of the page. p: Put on a special page for floats only. !: Override internal parameters LaTeX uses for determining “good” float positions. H: Place the float at precisely the location in the LaTeX code. This requires the float package (\\usepackage{float}). These specifiers can be used in conjunction, e.g., !b forces LaTeX to place the figure at the bottom of a page. The default behavior is tbp. That is, LaTeX will try to position the figure at the top of the page, then at the bottom, and then on a separate page. 6.5.2 Prevent figures from floating Many users will initially want to prevent figures from floating in their document, replicating the behavior of a traditional word processor. To do this, we must firstly load the LaTeX package float. This can be done by including the following line in the YAML: output: pdf_document: extra_dependencies: [&quot;float&quot;] We can use the chunk option fig.pos to control the float behavior. The option value H from float will prevent any floating within the document. We can set the default behavior for the document so that all chunks have this setting by including the following line in the first code chunk in your R Markdown document: knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.pos = &quot;H&quot;, out.extra = &quot;&quot;) In general, we do not recommend that users force LaTeX to stop floating figures. This solution was included in this book by popular demand,10 but there could be some serious side effects when LaTeX is unable to float figures. 6.5.3 Force floats forward An alternative to forcing all floats to be held is to force floating forward in the text. This can remove a common issue, where a figure is shown at the top of the page before the relevant text comes. This can break the reading flow of a report. We can force the figure to always appear after the text by using the flafter LaTeX package as follows: output: pdf_document: extra_dependencies: [&quot;flafter&quot;] 6.5.4 Adjust LaTeX placement rules (*) LaTeX’s own float placement parameters could prevent placements that seem entirely “reasonable” to you—they are notoriously rather conservative. These defaults are displayed in Table 6.1. TABLE 6.1: Default LaTeX float settings. Command Description Default topfraction max fraction of page for floats at top 0.7 bottomfraction max fraction of page for floats at bottom 0.3 textfraction min fraction of page for text 0.2 floatpagefraction min fraction of page that should have floats 0.5 topnumber max number of floats at top of page 2 bottomnumber max number of floats at bottom of page 1 totalnumber max number of floats on a page 3 To encourage LaTeX not to move your figures, we can alter these default settings. We could include the following in our LaTeX preamble file, reducing the minimum amount of text required on a page and allow more room for floats: \\renewcommand{\\topfraction}{.85} \\renewcommand{\\bottomfraction}{.7} \\renewcommand{\\textfraction}{.15} \\renewcommand{\\floatpagefraction}{.66} \\setcounter{topnumber}{3} \\setcounter{bottomnumber}{3} \\setcounter{totalnumber}{4} If we have added these lines to a .tex file, we could include this file in the preamble of the LaTeX document using the method introduced in Section 6.1.

Sub-figures allow us to achieve this by arranging multiple images within a single environment and providing each with its own sub-caption. Sub-figures require the LaTeX package subfig. We can load it via the extra_dependencies YAML option within the pdf_document output. For example: --- output: pdf_document: extra_dependencies: &quot;subfig&quot; --- To arrange all plots from a code chunk in sub-figures, you have to use the chunk options fig.cap (the caption for the whole figure environment) and fig.subcap (a character vector of the captions for sub-figures). For best output, you can also use the following options: fig.ncol: The number of columns of sub-figures. By default, all plots are arranged in a single row. You can break them into multiple rows. out.width: The output width of individual plots. You will normally set this to 100% divided by the number of columns. For example, if you have two plots, the out.width option should be equal to or less than 50%, otherwise the plots may exceed the page margin. Below is an illustrative example: --- output: pdf_document: extra_dependencies: &quot;subfig&quot; --- ```{r, fig.cap=&#39;Figure 1&#39;, fig.subcap=c(&#39;(a)&#39;, &#39;(b)&#39;, &#39;(c)&#39;)} plot(1:10) plot(cars, pch = 19) boxplot(Sepal.Width ~ Species, data = iris) ``` The output is shown in Figure 6.2.

Below is a simple template that only contains a single variable $body$: \\documentclass{article} \\begin{document} $body$ \\end{document} The value of $body$ is the LaTeX code generated from the body of the Markdown document. For example, if the body text is Hello **world**! in Markdown, the value of $body$ will be Hello \\textbf{world}!. If the LaTeX customization methods in Sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4 are not enough for you, you may try to use a custom template instead. A template allows you to use arbitrary LaTeX code in it, and hence is much more flexible. To use a template, include the path of the template in the template option of pdf_document, e.g., output: pdf_document: template: my-template.tex The default LaTeX template of Pandoc can be found at https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/tree/master/data/templates (named default.latex). If you want to create your own template, you may want to start with this template. For the full list of Pandoc variables and their meanings (such as $body$ and $title$), see Pandoc’s manual at https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#templates. You can also use arbitrary custom variables, which are typically passed to the template from the YAML metadata.

The consequence is that special LaTeX characters may be escaped, e.g., Pandoc may convert a backslash \\ to \\textbackslash{}.

Simplicity is both its advantage and disadvantage. LaTeX is much more powerful than Markdown in terms of typesetting at the price of more commands to be typed. If typesetting is of much higher priority to you and you are comfortable with using all kinds of LaTeX commands and environments, you can just use pure LaTeX code instead of Markdown to write the whole document. The knitr package supports a variety of source document formats, including but not limited to R Markdown. Below is an example of intermingling R code with pure LaTeX code: \\documentclass{article} \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} \\begin{document} Here is a code chunk. &lt;&lt;foo, fig.height=4&gt;&gt;= 1 + 1 par(mar = c(4, 4, .2, .2)) plot(rnorm(100)) @ You can also write inline expressions, e.g. $\\pi=\\Sexpr{pi}$, and \\Sexpr{1.9910214e28} is a big number. \\end{document} The filename usually has the extension .Rnw, e.g., the above file is latex.Rnw. The idea is the same but the syntax for writing R code chunks and inline R expressions is different. An R code chunk starts with &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;= (with optional chunk options inside the angle brackets) and ends with @. An inline R expression is written in \\Sexpr{}. The function knitr::knit() can compile an Rnw document to a LaTeX (.tex) output file, which can be further compiled to PDF through your LaTeX tools such as pdflatex. You can also use knitr::knit2pdf() to compile Rnw to PDF in one step. If you use RStudio, you can hit the Compile PDF button on the toolbar. Please note that the default method to compile Rnw documents is through Sweave, and you may want to change it to knitr (see the post http://stackoverflow.com/q/27592837/559676 for how to do that). An Rnw document gives you the full power of LaTeX. This could be your last resort if there are typesetting problems that are really difficult to solve in Markdown.

"],["chunk-styling.html", "7.3 Style code blocks and text output", " 7.3 Style code blocks and text output We can customize the style of code chunks and their text output using the chunk options class.source and class.output, respectively. These options take character vectors of class names (see Section 11.13 for more information). For example, when class.source = \"important\", the HTML element containing the code chunk in the output will have a class important. Then you can define CSS rules for this class.11 This can be useful when you want to highlight a certain code chunk or its text output. By default, the HTML output of R Markdown includes the Bootstrap framework, which makes it easy for you to change the appearance of your code and output, because Bootstrap has predefined some CSS classes for backgrounds: \"bg-primary\", \"bg-success\", \"bg-info\", \"bg-warning\", and \"bg-danger\". Below is an example using the chunk options class.source = \"bg-danger\" and class.output = \"bg-warning\", and you can see its output in Figure 7.1. --- title: Change the chunk style output: html_document --- When you subset a data frame, it does not necessarily return a data frame. For example, if you subset two columns, you get a data frame, but when you try to subset one column, you get a vector: ```{r class.source=&quot;bg-danger&quot;, class.output=&quot;bg-warning&quot;} mtcars[1:5, &quot;mpg&quot;] ``` To make sure that we always get a data frame, we have to use the argument `drop = FALSE`. Now we use the chunk option `class.source = &quot;bg-success&quot;`. ```{r df-drop-ok, class.source=&quot;bg-success&quot;} mtcars[1:5, &quot;mpg&quot;, drop = FALSE] ``` FIGURE 7.1: A code chunk and its text output with background colors defined by Bootstrap. You can also use arbitrary class names and define CSS rules accordingly. In this case, you will have to include your custom CSS rules using the methods mentioned in Section 7.1. Below is an example: --- title: Assign custom classes to chunks output: html_document --- First we define some CSS rules for a class `watch-out`. ```{css, echo=FALSE} .watch-out { background-color: lightpink; border: 3px solid red; font-weight: bold; } ``` Then we assign a class `watch-out` to the code chunk via the chunk option `class.source`. ```{r class.source=&quot;watch-out&quot;} mtcars[1:5, &quot;mpg&quot;] ``` The output style is shown in Figure 7.2. FIGURE 7.2: A code chunk with a light pink background color and a thick red border. If you want all code blocks in the document to use the custom style, you can set class.source in the global knitr options, e.g., knitr::opts_chunk$set(class.source = &quot;watch-out&quot;) You can apply multiple classes to the code blocks. For example, with class.source = c(\"important\", \"warning\"), the code block will have two classes, “important” and “warning.” If you want to decorate individual elements in code blocks instead of the whole blocks, you may consider using the flair package (Bodwin and Glanz 2025). With this package, you can highlight different parts of your code (such as fixed strings, function names, and arguments) with custom styles (e.g., color, font size, and/or font weight).

Otherwise the page may look overwhelmingly lengthy, and it will be difficult for those who do not want to read the details in the code or its text output to skip these parts. There are multiple ways to solve this problem. One solution is to use the code_folding option in the html_document format. This option will fold code blocks in the output and readers can unfold them by clicking a button (see Section 7.5 for more details). The other possible solution is to make the code blocks scrollable within a fixed height when they are too long. This can be achieved by the CSS properties max-height and overflow-y. Below is a full example with the output in Figure 7.3: --- title: Scrollable code blocks output: html_document --- ```{css, echo=FALSE} pre { max-height: 300px; overflow-y: auto; } pre[class] { max-height: 100px; } ``` We have defined some CSS rules to limit the height of code blocks.

In the above example, we defined a global maximum height of 300px for all code blocks. Remember that code blocks are placed in &lt;pre&gt; tags in the HTML output. Then we limited the height of &lt;pre&gt; blocks to 100px with class attributes. That is what the CSS selector pre[class] means. By default, text output will be contained in &lt;pre&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;, and R code blocks are contained in &lt;pre class=\"r\"&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; (note that the &lt;pre&gt; tag has a class attribute here). The height of the text output from the second R code chunk is also 100px. That is because we assigned a custom class name scroll-100 to the output, and defined the maximum height to be 100px.

To use these functions, make sure you have the following R packages available: xfun::pkg_load2(c(&quot;htmltools&quot;, &quot;mime&quot;)) Then you can use one of the functions xfun::embed_file(), xfun::embed_files(), or xfun::embed_dir() in an R code chunk to embed one or multiple files or an entire directory in the HTML output, e.g., ```{r echo=FALSE} # a single file xfun::embed_file(&#39;source.Rmd&#39;) # multiple files xfun::embed_files(c(&#39;source.Rmd&#39;, &#39;data.csv&#39;)) # a directory xfun::embed_dir(&#39;data/&#39;, text = &#39;Download full data&#39;) ``` You can also provide the list of files programmatically, e.g., # embed all Rmd and csv files xfun::embed_files(list.files(&quot;.&quot;, &quot;[.](Rmd|csv)$&quot;)) For multiple files, they are first compressed to a zip file, and the zip file will be embedded. These functions return a link, on which a reader can click on the HTML page to download the embedded file. You can learn more technical details behind these functions from the help page ?xfun::embed_file or the blog post at https://yihui.org/en/2018/07/embed-file/. Based on the same idea, the downloadthis package (Mattioni Maturana 2025) has implemented download buttons, so that users can click buttons to download files instead of links. If you prefer using buttons, you may consider using this package.

If you want to include the compiled results of an Rmd document in another Rmd document, the former Rmd document may use the html_fragment format instead of the usual html_document.

"],["favicon.html", "7.11 Add a custom browser icon", " 7.11 Add a custom browser icon Section 7.10 demonstrates that we can inject additional code into the HTML head, body, or footer with the includes option of the html_document format. This technique can be used to add a custom browser icon, called a favicon, to your HTML output. Favicons are the website logos that are displayed in your browser’s address bar, tab title, history, and bookmarks. For example, if you visit the CRAN website (https://cran.r-project.org) in Google Chrome, and look at the browser tab, you will see a small R logo. On mobile devices, favicons are also used in place of an App icon for websites that are pinned to the home screen. To add a favicon to your HTML document, add the following line of code to a custom header file (such as the file header.html mentioned in Section 7.10): &lt;link rel=&quot;shortcut icon&quot; href=&quot;{path to favicon file}&quot; /&gt; Recall that this file can be injected into the document &lt;head&gt; area using the YAML metadata: output: html_document: includes: in_header: header.html The path you provide to the href attribute in &lt;link&gt; should assume the same relative path structure as you would use to reference any other asset (e.g., an image or dataset). For the image itself, most small, square PNG files will work reasonably well. Bear in mind that a typical web browser will often display the image in a 16 x 16 pixel box, so simple designs are better. If you want to ensure that each browser or platform on which your document is viewed uses a version of your icon with optimal resolution for its specific layout, you may use a service such as https://realfavicongenerator.net to generate a set of favicons and a slightly more complex version of the header HTML code. This service is currently used by the pkgdown package’s pkgdown::build_favicon() function (Wickham, Hesselberth, et al. 2025) to make a set of favicons out of R package logos.

"],["html-share.html", "7.13 Sharing HTML output on the web", " 7.13 Sharing HTML output on the web One appealing aspect of rendering R Markdown to HTML files is that it is very easy to host these files on the Internet and share them just as one shares any other website. This section briefly summarizes numerous options for sharing the HTML documents that you have created. 7.13.1 R-specific services RStudio offers a number of services for publishing various types of content created in R Markdown to the Internet. These services make it particularly easy to publish content by using the RStudio IDE or the rsconnect package (Atkins et al. 2025). RPubs enables free hosting of static single-file R Markdown content. It is easy to publish via the Publish button in the RStudio IDE or the rsconnect::rpubsUpload() function. Please see the “Getting Started” page (https://rpubs.com/about/getting-started) for more details. ShinyApps.io allows for hosting dynamic content that requires a server to run R. For example, one can host interactive R Markdown documents that include Shiny components.12 ShinyApps.io is an analog to RPubs for Shiny applications. Apps and interactive R Markdown documents can be published using the push-button in the RStudio IDE or the rsconnect::deployApp() function. See the user guide (https://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/) for more details. bookdown.org offers free hosting specifically for books written with the bookdown package. You may easily publish static output files of your book using the bookdown::publish_book() function. RStudio Connect is an enterprise product that organizations may run on their own servers. It can host a wide variety of content created in R (such as R Markdown documents, Shiny apps, and APIs) in a secured environment with document-level access controls, viewership history, and more. Content can be published to RStudio Connect using manual upload, the rsconnect package, or with GIT-based deployment. 7.13.2 Static website services In a few words, a simple static website is composed of any number of HTML files (typically containing an index.html, which is the homepage), JavaScript, CSS files, and additional content such as images. This collection of files can be hosted as-is on a web server and rendered in a web browser. When R Markdown is rendered to the HTML output format, the result may be treated as a static website. Websites can range in complexity from a single, standalone HTML file (which is what we get when we use the default self_contained: true option), a set of files, or a sophisticated project like a website based on blogdown (which relies upon a static website generator). For more details, see Section 2.1 on Static Sites of the blogdown book (Xie, Hill, and Thomas 2017). As a result, in addition to R-specific services, you may host your HTML document on many freely available static website hosting services. Commonly used options in the R community are: GitHub Pages makes it particularly easy to publish Markdown and HTML content straight from a GitHub repository. You may specify whether to host content from either the main branch’s root, a docs/ directory on the main branch, or a specific gh-pages branch. Publishing new content can be as simple as pushing new HTML files to your repository via GIT. GitLab Pages offers similar functionality to GitHub Pages for GitLab repositories. GitLab deploys content stores in the public/ directory of a repository. To build and publish content, you must provide a YAML file, .gitlab-ci.yml with instructions, but GitLab provides many helpful templates. For an example of hosting rendered HTML content, please see https://gitlab.com/pages/plain-html/-/tree/master. Netlify is a platform to build and deploy static website content. It is a popular choice for web content created by the blogdown and pkgdown packages, but it can host all kinds of HTML files. There are many different publishing options including drag-and-drop, command line, or automated publishing from GitHub and GitLab repositories. Additionally, Netlify offers many helpful features such as website previews in pull requests. See the Netlify documentation (https://docs.netlify.com) or the RStudio webinar “Sharing on Short Notice” for more details. References "],["html-accessibility.html", "7.14 Improve accessibility of HTML pages", " 7.14 Improve accessibility of HTML pages It is important to make your HTML output documents accessible to readers who are visually impaired or blind. These readers often have to use special tools, such as screen readers, to hear instead of visually reading your documents. Usually, screen readers can only read out text, but not (raster) images. This means you need to provide enough text hints to screen readers. The good news is that with some small efforts, you can actually greatly enhance the accessibility of your documents. Jonathan Godfrey has provided some tips in the article at https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/rmarkdown/ on making accessible R Markdown documents.13 Based on this article, we highlight some tips below for the convenience of the readers of this book: HTML documents are often more accessible than PDF. Try to provide the Rmd source document along with the HTML output document if possible (e.g., Section 7.7 demonstrates one way to do this). In case anything in the HTML document is not accessible, the blind reader may be able to figure it out from the Rmd source, or fix it in the source. Provide informative text tags to your graphics. At the useR! conference in 2014, Jonathan explained this issue to me in person. It was the first time that I had learned about the importance of the alt attribute of images on web pages. To understand this problem, first you have to know that images on web pages are generated by the HTML tag &lt;img /&gt;. This tag has an src attribute, which points to the source of the image, e.g., &lt;img src=\"foo_figures/image.png\" /&gt;. Sighted readers can see the image, but it is hard for blind users to know anything about the image, because usually screen readers cannot read it, especially when it is a raster image (vector graphics can be better, such as SVG). In this case, it is helpful to provide a text hint, which screen readers can read out to the blind reader. This text hint can be provided in the alt attribute of the image, which stands for “alternate text.” For images generated from code chunks in R Markdown, the alt attribute will be generated if you provide the chunk option fig.cap (i.e., figure caption). Alternatively, you can insert an image using the Markdown syntax ![](). You input the image path in parentheses, and the alt text in square brackets, e.g., ![an informative text](path/to/image.png). The alt text is not displayed to sighted readers on an HTML page. However, when you provide the figure caption or alternate text to an image, the rmarkdown::html_document format will render a visible figure caption element by default. If you do not want the real figure captions, you can turn off the fig_caption option, e.g., output: html_document: fig_caption: false In this case, the alt attributes will still be generated, but are no longer visible. Write mathematical content using the LaTeX syntax (e.g., $ $ or $$ $$) instead of images. By default, R Markdown uses the MathJax library to render math content, and the result is readable to screen readers. Get rid of the leading hashes (##) in the text output of code chunks by setting the chunk option comment = \"\" (see Section 11.12). We are not experts on accessibility, so we recommend that you read the original article to learn more details. JooYoung Seo has also published a post about a few R packages to help visually impaired users at https://jooyoungseo.com/post/ds4blind/. It is not directly related to R Markdown, but it can be helpful for you to learn how blind users read graphs.↩︎ "],["html-hardcore.html", "7.15 For hardcore HTML users (*)", " 7.15 For hardcore HTML users (*) In Section 6.12, we mentioned that if you feel the constraint of Markdown (due to its simplicity) is too strong, you can embed code chunks in a pure LaTeX document instead of Markdown. Similarly, if you are familiar and comfortable with writing raw HTML code, you can intermingle code chunks with HTML, too. Such documents have the conventional filename extension .Rhtml. In an Rhtml document, code chunks are embedded between &lt;!--begin.rcode and end.rcode--&gt;, and inline R expressions are embedded in &lt;!--rinline --&gt;. Below is a full Rhtml example. You can save it to a file named test.Rhtml, and use knitr::knit(\"test.Rhtml\") to compile it. The output will be an HTML (.html) file.

"],["word-template.html", "8.1 Custom Word templates", " 8.1 Custom Word templates You can apply the styles defined in a Word template document to new Word documents generated from R Markdown. Such a template document is also called a “style reference document.” The key is that you have to create this template document from Pandoc first, and change the style definitions in it later. Then pass the path of this template to the reference_docx option of word_document, e.g., --- output: word_document: reference_docx: &quot;template.docx&quot; --- As we just mentioned, the document template.docx has to be generated from Pandoc. You can create this template from an arbitrary R Markdown document with the word_document output format (the actual content of this document does not matter, but it should contain the type of elements of which you want to style). Then open the .docx file, and edit the styles. FIGURE 8.1: Find the styles of a specific document element. Figure 8.1 shows that you can open the “Styles” window from the “HOME” tab in Word. When you move the cursor to a specific element in the document, an item in the styles list will be highlighted. If you want to modify the style of any type of element, you can click the drop-down menu on the highlighted item, and you will see a dialog box like Figure 8.2. FIGURE 8.2: Modify the styles of an element in a Word document. After you finish modifying the styles, you can save the document (with a filename that will not be accidentally overwritten), and use it as the template for future Word documents. When Pandoc renders a new Word document with a reference document (template), it will read the styles in the template and apply them to the new document. You may watch a short video at https://vimeo.com/110804387, or read the article at https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html for more detailed instructions on how to create a Word template with custom styles. Sometimes it may not be straightforward to find the style name for an element. There may be multiple styles applied to the same element, and you will only see one of them highlighted in the list of styles. It may require some guesswork and online searching to figure out the actual style that you want to modify. For example, you have to click the “Manage Styles” button (the third button from left to right at the bottom of the style list in Figure 8.1), and scroll through a large number of style names before you find the “Table” style (see Figure 8.3). Then you can modify this style for your tables (e.g., add borders). FIGURE 8.3: Modify the styles of tables in a Word document. "],["word-redoc.html", "8.2 The two-way workflow between R Markdown and Word", " 8.2 The two-way workflow between R Markdown and Word While it is easy to generate a Word document from R Markdown, things can be particularly painful when someone else edits the Word document and you have to manually port the changes back to the original R Markdown document. Luckily, Noam Ross has provided a promising solution to this problem. The redoc package (https://github.com/noamross/redoc) allows you to generate a Word document, revise the Word document, and convert the revised Word document back to R Markdown. Please note that as of this writing (June 2020), the redoc package is still experimental, and more unfortunately, its author has suspended the development. Anyway, if you want to try it out, you can install the package from GitHub: remotes::install_github(&quot;noamross/redoc&quot;) Once the package is installed, you may use the output format redoc::redoc: --- output: redoc::redoc --- This output format generates a Word document that actually stores the original Rmd document, so the Word document can be converted back to Rmd. Tracked changes in Word will be converted to text written with the CriticMarkup syntax (http://criticmarkup.com). For example, {++ important ++} represents the insertion of the word “important” in the text. You can convert the Word document generated by redoc::redoc to Rmd via the function redoc::dedoc(), e.g., redoc::dedoc(\"file.docx\") will generate file.Rmd. In this process, you can decide how to deal with tracked changes in Word via the track_changes argument, e.g., you may accept or reject changes, or convert tracked changes to CriticMarkup. We recommend that you use track_changes = 'criticmarkup' to avoid the permanent loss of tracked changes. When editing the Word document, you are expected to edit the parts that are not automatically generated by code chunks or inline R expressions in R Markdown. For example, you must not edit a table if it is automatically generated by knitr::kable() in a code chunk, because such changes will be lost when you convert Word to Rmd via dedoc(). To avoid accidentally editing the automatic results from code chunks, you may set the option highlight_outputs to true in the redoc::redoc format, which means the automatic output will be highlighted in Word (with a background color). You should tell your collaborator that they should not touch these highlighted parts in the Word document. Again, the redoc package is still experimental and its future is unclear at the moment, so the introduction here is intentionally brief. When in doubt, we recommend that you read its documentation on GitHub.

Continuing his effort to make it easier to work with Office documents in R, David Gohel started to develop the officedown package (Gohel and Ross 2025) in 2018, which aims to bring some officer (Gohel, Moog, and Heckmann 2026) features into R Markdown. As of this writing, this package is still experimental, although its initial version has been published on CRAN. You may either install it from CRAN or GitHub: # install from CRAN install.packages(&quot;officedown&quot;) # or GitHub remotes::install_github(&quot;davidgohel/officedown&quot;) After the package is installed, you need to load it in your R Markdown document, e.g., ```{r, setup, include=FALSE} library(officedown) ``` There is an output format rdocx_document in the officedown package, which is based on rmarkdown::word_document by default, and has several other features such as styling tables and plots. The officedown package allows you to style specific Word elements via the officer package. For example, you can create a style via the function officer::fp_text(), and apply the style to a piece of text via ftext() an inline R expression: --- title: Style text with officedown output: officedown::rdocx_document: default --- ```{r} library(officedown) library(officer) ft &lt;- fp_text(color = &#39;red&#39;, bold = TRUE) ``` # Test The **officedown** package is `r ftext(&#39;awesome&#39;, ft)`! Besides functions in officer, officedown also allows you to use some special HTML comments to perform officer tasks. For example, the function officer::block_pour_docx() can be used to import an external Word document into the current document, and alternatively, you can use the HTML comment in R Markdown: &lt;!---BLOCK_POUR_DOCX{file: &#39;my-file.docx&#39;}---&gt; That is equivalent to the inline R expression: `r block_pour_docx(file = &#39;my-file.docx&#39;)` Other things you may do with officedown and officer include the following: Insert page breaks. Put content in a multi-column layout. Change paragraph settings. Insert a table of contents. Change the orientation of a section (landscape or portrait).

For example, this book was written in R Markdown, and compiled to two formats: PDF for printing, and HTML for the online version. Sometimes it can be challenging to make an output element of a code chunk work for all output formats. For example, it is extremely simple to create a rounded and circular image in HTML output with a single CSS rule (img { border-radius: 50%; }), but not so straightforward in LaTeX output (typically it will involve TikZ graphics). Sometimes it is just impossible for an output element to work for all output formats. For example, you can easily create a GIF animation with the gifski package (Ooms, Kornel Lesiński, and Authors of the dependency Rust crates 2025) (see Section 4.14), and it will work perfectly for HTML output, but embedding such an animation in LaTeX output is not possible without extra steps of processing the GIF file and using extra LaTeX packages. This chapter provides a few examples that can work for multiple formats. If a certain feature is only available to a specific output format, we will show you how to conditionally enable or disable it based on the output format. References "],["latex-html.html", "9.1 LaTeX or HTML output", " 9.1 LaTeX or HTML output LaTeX and HTML are two commonly used output formats. The function knitr::is_latex_output() tells you if the output format is LaTeX (including Pandoc output formats latex and beamer). Similarly, the function knitr::is_html_output tells you if the output format is HTML. By default, these Pandoc output formats are considered HTML formats: markdown, epub, html, html4, html5, revealjs, s5, slideous, and slidy. If you do not think a certain Pandoc format is HTML, you may use the excludes argument to exclude it, e.g., # do not treat markdown as an HTML format knitr::is_html_output(excludes = &quot;markdown&quot;) ## [1] TRUE If a certain output element can only be generated in LaTeX or HTML, you can use these functions to conditionally generate it. For example, when a table is too big on a PDF page, you may include the table in an environment of a smaller font size, but such a LaTeX environment certainly will not work for HTML output, so it should not be included in HTML output (if you want to tweak the font size for HTML output, you may use CSS). Below is a full example: --- title: Render a table in a tiny environment output: pdf_document: default html_document: default --- ```{r, setup, include=FALSE} knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE) options(knitr.table.format = function() { if (knitr::is_latex_output()) &#39;latex&#39; else &#39;pandoc&#39; }) ``` The LaTeX environment `tiny` is only generated for LaTeX output. ```{r, include=knitr::is_latex_output()} knitr::asis_output(&#39;\\n\\n\\\\begin{tiny}&#39;) ``` ```{r} knitr::kable(mtcars) ``` ```{r, include=knitr::is_latex_output()} knitr::asis_output(&#39;\\\\end{tiny}\\n\\n&#39;) ``` By comparison, below is the table with the normal font size. ```{r} knitr::kable(mtcars) ``` The key in the above example is the chunk option include = knitr::is_latex_output(). That is, the environment \\begin{tiny} \\end{tiny} is only included when the output format is LaTeX. The two tables in the example will look identical when the output format is not LaTeX. In Section 5.1, we used these functions to change the text color for HTML and LaTeX output. In Section 4.14, we showed an animation example, which also used this trick. The code chunk that generated the animation for HTML output and static images for LaTeX output is like this: ```{r animation.hook=if (knitr::is_html_output()) &#39;gifski&#39;} for (i in 1:2) { pie(c(i %% 2, 6), col = c(&#39;red&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;), labels = NA) } ``` These conditional functions can be used anywhere. You can use them in other chunk options (e.g., eval for conditional evaluation of the chunk), or in your R code, e.g., ```{r, eval=knitr::is_html_output(), echo=FALSE} cat(&#39;You will only see me in HTML output.&#39;) ``` ```{r} if (knitr::is_latex_output()) { knitr::asis_output(&#39;\\n\\n\\\\begin{tiny}&#39;) } ``` "],["html-widgets.html", "9.2 Display HTML widgets", " 9.2 Display HTML widgets HTML widgets (https://www.htmlwidgets.org) are typically interactive JavaScript applications, which only work in HTML output. If you knit an Rmd document containing HTML widgets to a non-HTML format such as PDF or Word, you may get an error message like this: Error: Functions that produce HTML output found in document targeting X output. Please change the output type of this document to HTML. Alternatively, you can allow HTML output in non-HTML formats by adding this option to the YAML front-matter of your rmarkdown file: always_allow_html: yes Note however that the HTML output will not be visible in non-HTML formats. There is actually a better solution than the one mentioned in the above error message, but it involves extra packages. You can install the webshot2 package (Chang 2025) in R and also install Google Chrome or any other Chromium-based browser if you do not have such a browser installed: install.packages(&quot;webshot2&quot;) Then if you knit an Rmd document with HTML widgets to a non-HTML format, the HTML widgets will be displayed as static screenshots. The screenshots are automatically taken in knitr. Section 2.10 of the bookdown book contains more information on finer control over the screenshots. References "],["include-url.html", "9.3 Embed a web page", " 9.3 Embed a web page If you have the webshot2 package (Chang 2025) and Chrome installed (see Section 9.2), you can embed any web page in the output document through knitr::include_url(). When you pass a URL of a web page to this function in a code chunk, it will generate an &lt;iframe&gt; (inline frame) if the output format is HTML, and a screenshot of the web page for other output formats. You can view the actual page in the inline frame. Most chunk options related to figures also work for knitr::include_url(), such as out.width and fig.cap. If you have published a Shiny app publicly on a server, you can use knitr::include_app() to include it, which works in the same way as include_url(). Section 2.11 of the bookdown book (Xie 2016) contains more details about include_app() and include_url(). References "],["figures-side.html", "9.4 Multiple figures side by side", " 9.4 Multiple figures side by side You can place multiple figures side by side using the fig.show=\"hold\" along with the out.width option.

"],["raw-content.html", "9.5 Write raw content (*)", " 9.5 Write raw content (*) The technique introduced in Section 6.11 is actually a general technique. You can protect any complex raw content in Markdown by specifying the content as “raw.” For example, if you want to write raw HTML content, you can use the attribute =html: ```{=html} &lt;p&gt;Any &lt;strong&gt;raw&lt;/strong&gt; HTML content works here. For example, here is a Youtube video:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3JldKoA0zw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; ``` The attribute name is the Pandoc output format name.

For example, raw LaTeX content will be ignored when the output format is HTML. "],["custom-blocks.html", "9.6 Custom blocks (*)", " 9.6 Custom blocks (*) Section 2.7 of the bookdown book mentioned how we can use custom blocks in R Markdown to customize the appearance of blocks of content. This can be a useful way to make some content stand out from your report or book, to make sure that your readers take away the key points from your work. Examples of how these blocks could be used include: display a warning message to make sure users are using up-to-date packages before running your analysis; add a link at the beginning of your document to your GitHub repository containing the source; highlight key results and findings from your analysis. In this section, we will explain how to create your own custom blocks for both PDF and HTML output. They can both use the same formatting syntax in the R Markdown document, but require different configurations. 9.6.1 Syntax The syntax for custom blocks is based on Pandoc’s fenced Div blocks. Div blocks are very powerful, but there is a problem at the moment: they mainly work for HTML output and do not work for LaTeX output. Since version 1.16 of the rmarkdown package, it has been possible to convert Div blocks to both HTML and LaTeX. For HTML output, all attributes of the block will become attributes of the &lt;div&gt; tag. For example, a Div can have an ID (after #), one or multiple classes (class names are written after .), and other attributes. The following Div block ::: {#hello .greeting .message style=&quot;color: red;&quot;} Hello **world**! ::: will be converted to the HTML code below: &lt;div id=&quot;hello&quot; class=&quot;greeting message&quot; style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt; Hello &lt;strong&gt;world&lt;/strong&gt;! &lt;/div&gt; For LaTeX output, the first class name will be used as the LaTeX environment name. You should also provide an attribute named data-latex in the Div block, which will be the arguments of the environment. This attribute can be an empty string if the environment does not need arguments. We show two simple examples below. The first example uses the verbatim environment in LaTeX, which does not have any arguments: ::: {.verbatim data-latex=&quot;&quot;} We show some _verbatim_ text here. ::: Its LaTeX output will be: \\begin{verbatim} We show some \\emph{verbatim} text here. \\end{verbatim} When the block is converted to HTML, the HTML code will be: &lt;div class=&quot;verbatim&quot;&gt; We show some &lt;em&gt;verbatim&lt;/em&gt; text here. &lt;/div&gt; The second example uses the center and minipage environments to display some text in a centered box of half of the page width. :::: {.center data-latex=&quot;&quot;} ::: {.minipage data-latex=&quot;{.5\\linewidth}&quot;} This paragraph will be centered on the page, and its width is 50% of the width of its parent element. ::: :::: Note that we nested the minipage block in the center block. You need more colons for a parent block to include a child block. In the above example, we used four colons (you can use five or more) for the center block. The two blocks will be converted to the LaTeX code below: \\begin{center} \\begin{minipage}{.5\\linewidth} This paragraph will be centered on the page, and its width is 50\\% of the width of its parent element. \\end{minipage} \\end{center} It is up to the user to define the appearance of their &lt;div&gt; blocks via CSS for the HTML output. Similarly, for LaTeX output, you may use the command \\newenvironment to define the environment if it has not been defined, or \\renewenvironment to redefine an existing environment in LaTeX. In the LaTeX definitions, you can decide on the appearance of these blocks in PDF. These customizations will normally be contained in their own files such as style.css or preamble.tex, and then included within the YAML options: --- output: html_document: css: style.css pdf_document: includes: in_header: preamble.tex --- Next we will demonstrate a few more advanced custom blocks that use custom CSS rules and LaTeX environments. You may find an additional example in Section 5.8, in which we arranged multiple blocks in a multi-column layout. 9.6.2 Adding a shaded box First, we show how to include content in a shaded box. The box has a black background with an orange frame with rounded corners. The text in the box is in white. For HTML output, we define these rules in a CSS file. If you are unfamiliar with CSS, there are plenty of free online tutorials, e.g., https://www.w3schools.com/css/. .blackbox { padding: 1em; background: black; color: white; border: 2px solid orange; border-radius: 10px; } .center { text-align: center; } For LaTeX output, we create a new environment named blackbox and based on the LaTeX package framed, with a black background and white text: \\usepackage{color} \\usepackage{framed} \\setlength{\\fboxsep}{.8em} \\newenvironment{blackbox}{ \\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0, 0, 0} % black \\color{white} \\begin{shaded}} {\\end{shaded}} We used the framed package in this book because it is fairly lightweight, but it is not possible to draw a colored frame with rounded corners with this package. To achieve the latter, you will need more sophisticated LaTeX packages such as tcolorbox (https://ctan.org/pkg/tcolorbox), which offers a set of very flexible options for creating shaded boxes. You can find many examples in its documentation. The LaTeX environment below will create a shaded box of similar appearance to the above CSS example: \\usepackage{tcolorbox} \\newtcolorbox{blackbox}{ colback=black, colframe=orange, coltext=white, boxsep=5pt, arc=4pt} Now we can use our custom box in both PDF and HTML output formats. The source code of the box is: :::: {.blackbox data-latex=&quot;&quot;} ::: {.center data-latex=&quot;&quot;} **NOTICE!** ::: Thank you for noticing this **new notice**! Your noticing it has been noted, and _will be reported to the authorities_! :::: The output is: NOTICE! Thank you for noticing this new notice! Your noticing it has been noted, and will be reported to the authorities! 9.6.3 Including icons We can make custom blocks even more visually appealing by including images in them. Images can also be an effective way to convey the content of the block. For the following example, we assume that we are working within a directory structure below, which is a simplified version of what is used to build this book: directory/ ├── your-report.Rmd ├── style.css ├── preamble.tex └── images/ └── ├── important.png ├── note.png └── caution.png We show the source code and output of the example before we explain how everything works: ::: {.infobox .caution data-latex=&quot;{caution}&quot;} **NOTICE!** Thank you for noticing this **new notice**! Your noticing it has been noted, and _will be reported to the authorities_! ::: The output is: NOTICE! Thank you for noticing this new notice! Your noticing it has been noted, and will be reported to the authorities! For the HTML output, we can add an image to the box through the background-image property in CSS. We insert the image into the background, and add enough padding on the left-hand side to avoid the text overlapping with this image. If you are using local images, the file path to the images is provided relative to the CSS file. For example: .infobox { padding: 1em 1em 1em 4em; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 2px solid orange; border-radius: 10px; background: #f5f5f5 5px center/3em no-repeat; } .caution { background-image: url(&quot;images/caution.png&quot;); } Note that we used two class names, .infobox and .caution, on the outer block. The infobox class will be used to define the shaded box with a colored border, and the caution class will be used to include the image. The advantage of using two classes is that we can define more blocks with different icons without repeating the setup of the shaded box. For example, if we need a warning box, we only need to define the following CSS rule without repeating rules in .infobox: .warning { background-image: url(&quot;images/warning.png&quot;); } Then you can create a warning box with the Markdown source code below: :::: {.infobox .warning data-latex=&quot;warning&quot;} Include the actual content here. :::: For the PDF output, we can create an infobox environment based on the blackbox environment defined in the previous example, and add the icon to the left side of the box. There are multiple ways of including images in a LaTeX environment. Here is only one of them (it does not precisely reproduce the box style defined in the CSS above): \\newenvironment{infobox}[1] { \\begin{itemize} \\renewcommand{\\labelitemi}{ \\raisebox{-.7\\height}[0pt][0pt]{ {\\setkeys{Gin}{width=3em,keepaspectratio} \\includegraphics{images/#1}} } } \\setlength{\\fboxsep}{1em} \\begin{blackbox} \\item } { \\end{blackbox} \\end{itemize} } Below we show more example blocks with different icons: NOTICE! Thank you for noticing this new notice! Your noticing it has been noted, and will be reported to the authorities! NOTICE! Thank you for noticing this new notice! Your noticing it has been noted, and will be reported to the authorities! NOTICE! Thank you for noticing this new notice! Your noticing it has been noted, and will be reported to the authorities! NOTICE! Thank you for noticing this new notice! Your noticing it has been noted, and will be reported to the authorities! Alternatively, you may use the LaTeX package awesomebox to generate boxes with icons in the PDF output. This package gives you a much larger number of icons to choose from. We give a brief example below: please refer to the package documentation for the possible LaTeX environments and their arguments. --- title: Awesome Boxes output: pdf_document: extra_dependencies: awesomebox --- A note box: ::: {.noteblock data-latex=&quot;&quot;} Thank you for noticing this **new notice**! Your noticing it has been noted, and _will be reported to the authorities_! ::: We define an R function `box_args()` to generate the arguments for the box: ```{r} box_args &lt;- function( vrulecolor = &#39;white&#39;, hrule = c(&#39;\\\\abLongLine&#39;, &#39;\\\\abShortLine&#39;, &#39;&#39;), title = &#39;&#39;, vrulewidth = &#39;0pt&#39;, icon = &#39;Bomb&#39;, iconcolor = &#39;black&#39; ) { hrule &lt;- match.arg(hrule) sprintf( &#39;[%s][%s][\\\\textbf{%s}]{%s}{\\\\fa%s}{%s}&#39;, vrulecolor, hrule, title, vrulewidth, icon, iconcolor ) } ``` Pass some arguments to the `awesomeblock` environment through an inline R expression: ::: {.awesomeblock data-latex=&quot;`r box_args(title = &#39;NOTICE!&#39;)`&quot;} Thank you for noticing this **new notice**! Your noticing it has been noted, and _will be reported to the authorities_! ::: "],["tables.html", "Chapter 10 Tables", " Chapter 10 Tables Tables are one of the primary ways in which we can communicate results in a report.

This chapter aims to do the following: Show all features of the table-generating function knitr::kable(). Highlight more advanced customization of tables using the kableExtra package (Zhu 2024). Provide a list of other packages that produce tables. References "],["kable.html", "10.1 The function knitr::kable()", " 10.1 The function knitr::kable() The kable() function in knitr is a very simple table generator, and is simple by design. It only generates tables for strictly rectangular data such as matrices and data frames. You cannot heavily format the table cells or merge cells. However, this function does have a large number of arguments for you to customize the appearance of tables: kable(x, format, digits = getOption(&quot;digits&quot;), row.names = NA, col.names = NA, align, caption = opts_current$get(&quot;tab.cap&quot;), label = NULL, format.args = list(), escape = TRUE, ...) 10.1.1 Supported table formats In most cases, knitr::kable(x) may be enough if you only need a simple table for the data object x. The format argument is automatically set according to the knitr source document format. Its possible values are pipe (tables with columns separated by pipes), simple (Pandoc’s simple tables), latex (LaTeX tables), html (HTML tables), and rst (reStructuredText tables). For R Markdown documents, kable() uses the pipe format for tables by default, which looks like this: knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, 1:4]), &quot;pipe&quot;) | | mpg| cyl| disp| hp| |:-----------------|----:|---:|----:|---:| |Mazda RX4 | 21.0| 6| 160| 110| |Mazda RX4 Wag | 21.0| 6| 160| 110| |Datsun 710 | 22.8| 4| 108| 93| |Hornet 4 Drive | 21.4| 6| 258| 110| |Hornet Sportabout | 18.7| 8| 360| 175| |Valiant | 18.1| 6| 225| 105| You can also generate simple tables, or tables in HTML, LaTeX, and reStructuredText: knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, 1:4]), &quot;simple&quot;) mpg cyl disp hp ------------------ ----- ---- ----- ---- Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 knitr::kable(mtcars[1:2, 1:2], &quot;html&quot;) &lt;table&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; &lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; mpg &lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; cyl &lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; Mazda RX4 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; 21 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; 6 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; Mazda RX4 Wag &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; 21 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; 6 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, 1:4]), &quot;latex&quot;) \\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r|r} \\hline &amp; mpg &amp; cyl &amp; disp &amp; hp\\\\ \\hline Mazda RX4 &amp; 21.0 &amp; 6 &amp; 160 &amp; 110\\\\ \\hline Mazda RX4 Wag &amp; 21.0 &amp; 6 &amp; 160 &amp; 110\\\\ \\hline Datsun 710 &amp; 22.8 &amp; 4 &amp; 108 &amp; 93\\\\ \\hline Hornet 4 Drive &amp; 21.4 &amp; 6 &amp; 258 &amp; 110\\\\ \\hline Hornet Sportabout &amp; 18.7 &amp; 8 &amp; 360 &amp; 175\\\\ \\hline Valiant &amp; 18.1 &amp; 6 &amp; 225 &amp; 105\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, 1:4]), &quot;rst&quot;) ================= ==== === ==== === \\ mpg cyl disp hp ================= ==== === ==== === Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 ================= ==== === ==== === Please note that only the formats pipe and simple are portable, i.e., they work for any output document format. Other table formats only work for specific output formats, e.g., format = 'latex' only works for LaTeX output documents. Using a specific table format will give you more control, at the price of sacrificing portability. If you only need one table format that is not the default format for a document, you can set the global R option knitr.table.format, e.g., options(knitr.table.format = &quot;latex&quot;) This option can also be a function that returns the format string or NULL. In the case of NULL, knitr will try to automatically decide the appropriate format. For example, we can use the latex format only when the output format is LaTeX: options(knitr.table.format = function() { if (knitr::is_latex_output()) &quot;latex&quot; else &quot;pipe&quot; }) 10.1.2 Change column names The names of columns in a data frame may not be the same as what we want to display to readers. In R, the column names of data often do not use spaces to separate words but dots or underscores instead. This may not feel natural when we read them in a table. We can use the col.names argument to replace the column names with a vector of new names. For example, we substitute the dots with spaces in the column names of the iris data: iris2 &lt;- head(iris) knitr::kable(iris2, col.names = gsub(&quot;[.]&quot;, &quot; &quot;, names(iris))) Sepal Length Sepal Width Petal Length Petal Width Species 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa The col.names argument can take an arbitrary character vector (not necessarily the modified column names via functions like gsub()), as long as the length of the vector is equal to the number of columns of the data object, e.g., knitr::kable( iris, col.names = c(&#39;We&#39;, &#39;Need&#39;, &#39;Five&#39;, &#39;Names&#39;, &#39;Here&#39;) ) 10.1.3 Specify column alignment To change the alignment of the table columns, you can use either a vector of values consisting of characters l (left), c (center), and r (right) or a single multi-character string for alignment, so kable(..., align = c('c', 'l')) can be shortened to kable(..., align = 'cl'). By default, numeric columns are right-aligned, and other columns are left-aligned. Here is an example: # left, center, center, right, right knitr::kable(iris2, align = &quot;lccrr&quot;) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa 10.1.4 Add a table caption You can add a caption to the table via the caption argument, e.g. (see Table 10.1 for the output), knitr::kable(iris2, caption = &quot;An example table caption.&quot;) TABLE 10.1: An example table caption.

First we show a few simple examples of round() and format() so you will understand how the arguments work later in kable(): round(1.234567, 0) ## [1] 1 round(1.234567, digits = 1) ## [1] 1.2 round(1.234567, digits = 3) ## [1] 1.235 format(1000, scientific = TRUE) ## [1] &quot;1e+03&quot; format(10000.123, big.mark = &quot;,&quot;) ## [1] &quot;10,000&quot; Then we round and format numbers in a table: d &lt;- cbind(X1 = runif(3), X2 = 10^c(3, 5, 7), X3 = rnorm(3, 0, 1000)) # at most 4 decimal places knitr::kable(d, digits = 4) X1 X2 X3 0.3539 1e+03 -1542.5533 0.2397 1e+05 723.3763 0.5100 1e+07 -571.9407 # round columns separately knitr::kable(d, digits = c(5, 0, 2)) X1 X2 X3 0.35389 1e+03 -1542.55 0.23970 1e+05 723.38 0.50996 1e+07 -571.94 # do not use the scientific notation knitr::kable(d, digits = 3, format.args = list(scientific = FALSE)) X1 X2 X3 0.354 1000 -1542.553 0.240 100000 723.376 0.510 10000000 -571.941 # add commas to big numbers knitr::kable(d, digits = 3, format.args = list(big.mark = &quot;,&quot;, scientific = FALSE)) X1 X2 X3 0.354 1,000 -1,542.553 0.240 100,000 723.376 0.510 10,000,000 -571.941 10.1.6 Display missing values By default, missing values (i.e., NA) are displayed as the character string NA in the table. You can replace them with other values or choose not to display anything (i.e., leave the NA cells empty) with the global R option knitr.kable.NA, e.g., we make NA cells empty in the second table and display ** in the third table below: d[rbind(c(1, 1), c(2, 3), c(3, 2))] &lt;- NA knitr::kable(d) # NA is displayed by default X1 X2 X3 NA 1e+03 -1542.6 0.2397 1e+05 NA 0.5100 NA -571.9 # replace NA with empty strings opts &lt;- options(knitr.kable.NA = &quot;&quot;) knitr::kable(d) X1 X2 X3 1e+03 -1542.6 0.2397 1e+05 0.5100 -571.9 options(knitr.kable.NA = &quot;**&quot;) knitr::kable(d) X1 X2 X3 ** 1e+03 -1542.6 0.2397 1e+05 ** 0.5100 ** -571.9 options(opts) # restore global R options 10.1.7 Escape special characters If you are familiar with HTML or LaTeX, you know that there are a few special characters in these languages. To generate safe output, kable() will escape these special characters by default via the argument escape = TRUE, which means all characters will be generated verbatim, and special characters lose their special meanings. For example, &gt; will be substituted with &amp;gt; for HTML tables, and _ will be escaped as \\_ for LaTeX tables. If you are an expert and know how to use special characters properly, you may disable this argument via escape = FALSE. In the second table below, we include a few LaTeX math expressions that contain special characters $, \\, and _: m &lt;- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars) d &lt;- coef(summary(m)) knitr::kable(d) Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|) (Intercept) -17.579 6.7584 -2.601 0.0123 speed 3.932 0.4155 9.464 0.0000 # add a few math expressions to row and column names rownames(d) &lt;- c(&quot;$\\\\beta_0$&quot;, &quot;$\\\\beta_1$&quot;) colnames(d)[4] &lt;- &quot;$P(T &gt; |t|)$&quot; knitr::kable(d, escape = FALSE) Estimate Std.

For example, $ is escaped as \\$, _ is escaped as \\_, and \\ is substituted with \\textbackslash{}: knitr::kable(d, format = &quot;latex&quot;, escape = TRUE) \\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r|r} \\hline &amp; Estimate &amp; Std. Error &amp; t value &amp; \\$P(T &gt; |t|)\\$\\\\ \\hline \\$\\textbackslash{}beta\\_0\\$ &amp; -17.579 &amp; 6.7584 &amp; -2.601 &amp; 0.0123\\\\ \\hline \\$\\textbackslash{}beta\\_1\\$ &amp; 3.932 &amp; 0.4155 &amp; 9.464 &amp; 0.0000\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} Other common special LaTeX characters include #, %, &amp;, {, and }. Common special HTML characters include &amp;, &lt;, &gt;, and \". You need to be cautious when generating tables with escape = FALSE, and make sure you are using the special characters in the right way. It is a very common mistake to use escape = FALSE and include % or _ in column names or the caption of a LaTeX table without realizing that they are special. If you are not sure how to properly escape special characters, there are helper functions in knitr and xfun. Below are some examples: knitr:::escape_latex(c(&quot;100%&quot;, &quot;# a comment&quot;, &quot;column_name&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;100\\\\%&quot; &quot;\\\\# a comment&quot; &quot;column\\\\_name&quot; xfun::html_escape(c(&quot;&lt;address&gt;&quot;, &quot;x = \\&quot;character\\&quot;&quot;, &quot;a &amp; b&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;&quot; &quot;x = \\&quot;character\\&quot;&quot; ## [3] &quot;a &amp;amp; b&quot; 10.1.8 Multiple tables side by side You can pass a list of data frames or matrices to kable() to generate multiple tables side by side. For example, Table 10.2 contains two tables generated from the code below: d1 &lt;- head(cars, 3) d2 &lt;- head(mtcars[, 1:3], 5) knitr::kable( list(d1, d2), caption = &#39;Two tables placed side by side.&#39;, booktabs = TRUE, valign = &#39;t&#39; ) TABLE 10.2: Two tables placed side by side. speed dist 4 2 4 10 7 4 mpg cyl disp Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 Please note that this feature only works for HTML and PDF output. If you want to be able to customize each table individually when placing them side by side, you may use the kables() function (the plural form of kable()), and pass a list of kable() objects to it. For example, we change the column names in the left table and set the number of decimal places to zero in the right table in Table 10.3: # data objects d1 and d2 are from the previous code chunk knitr::kables( list( # the first kable() to change column names knitr::kable( d1, col.names = c(&#39;SPEED&#39;, &#39;DISTANCE&#39;), valign = &#39;t&#39; ), # the second kable() to set the digits option knitr::kable(d2, digits = 0, valign = &#39;t&#39;) ), caption = &#39;Two tables created by knitr::kables().&#39; ) TABLE 10.3: Two tables created by knitr::kables(). SPEED DISTANCE 4 2 4 10 7 4 mpg cyl disp Mazda RX4 21 6 160 Mazda RX4 Wag 21 6 160 Datsun 710 23 4 108 Hornet 4 Drive 21 6 258 Hornet Sportabout 19 8 360 10.1.9 Generate multiple tables from a for-loop (*) One common confusion about kable() is that it does not work inside for-loops. This problem is not specific to kable() but exists in many other packages, too. The reason is a little complicated. In case you are interested in the technicality, it is explained in the blog post “The Ghost Printer behind Top-level R Expressions.” You may expect the following code chunk to generate three tables, but it will not: ```{r} for (i in 1:3) { knitr::kable(head(iris)) } ``` You have to explicitly print the kable() results, and apply the chunk option results = 'asis', e.g., ```{r, results=&#39;asis&#39;} for (i in 1:3) { print(knitr::kable(head(iris))) } ``` In general, when you generate output from a for-loop, we recommend that you add a few line breaks (\\n) or an HTML comment (&lt;!-- --&gt;) after each output element to clearly separate all output elements, e.g., ```{r, results=&#39;asis&#39;} for (i in 1:3) { print(knitr::kable(head(iris), caption = &#39;A caption.&#39;)) cat(&#39;\\n\\n&lt;!-- --&gt;\\n\\n&#39;) } ``` Without the separators, Pandoc may be fail to detect the individual elements. For example, when a plot is followed immediately by a table, the table will not be recognized: ![](logo.png) mpg cyl disp hp ------------------ ----- ---- ----- ---- Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 But it will be if there is a clear separation like this (note that we added an empty line below the image): ![](logo.png) mpg cyl disp hp ------------------ ----- ---- ----- ---- Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 or ![](logo.png) &lt;!-- --&gt; mpg cyl disp hp ------------------ ----- ---- ----- ---- Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 10.1.10 Customize LaTeX tables (*) If the only output format you need is LaTeX, there are a few extra options you can use in kable(). Note that these options will be ignored in other types of output such as HTML. Unless you have set the table format option globally (see Section 10.1.1), you will have to use the format argument of kable() explicitly in the examples of this section, e.g., knitr::kable(iris2, format = &quot;latex&quot;, booktabs = TRUE) When you assign a caption to a table (see Section 10.1.4), kable() will use the table environment to include the table, i.e., \\begin{table} % the table body (usually the tabular environment) \\end{table} You can change this environment via the table.envir argument, e.g., knitr::kable(cars[1:2, ], format = &quot;latex&quot;, table.envir = &quot;figure&quot;) \\begin{figure} \\begin{tabular}{r|r} \\hline speed &amp; dist\\\\ \\hline 4 &amp; 2\\\\ \\hline 4 &amp; 10\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{figure} The floating position of the table is controlled by the argument position. For example, we can try to force a table to float to the bottom of a page via position = \"!b\": knitr::kable(cars[1:2, ], format = &quot;latex&quot;, table.envir = &quot;table&quot;, position = &quot;!b&quot;) \\begin{table}[!b] \\begin{tabular}{r|r} \\hline speed &amp; dist\\\\ \\hline 4 &amp; 2\\\\ \\hline 4 &amp; 10\\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} When a table has a caption, you can also assign a short caption to it via the caption.short argument, e.g., knitr::kable(iris2, caption = &quot;A long long long caption!&quot;, caption.short = &quot;A short one.&quot;) The short caption goes into the square brackets of the \\caption[]{} command in LaTeX, and is often used in the List of Tables of the PDF output document (if the short caption is not provided, the full caption is displayed there). If you are familiar with the LaTeX package booktabs for publication-quality tables, you can set booktabs = TRUE, e.g., iris3 &lt;- head(iris, 10) knitr::kable(iris3, format = &quot;latex&quot;, booktabs = TRUE) \\begin{tabular}{rrrrl} \\toprule Sepal.Length &amp; Sepal.Width &amp; Petal.Length &amp; Petal.Width &amp; Species\\\\ \\midrule 5.1 &amp; 3.5 &amp; 1.4 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ 4.9 &amp; 3.0 &amp; 1.4 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ 4.7 &amp; 3.2 &amp; 1.3 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ 4.6 &amp; 3.1 &amp; 1.5 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ 5.0 &amp; 3.6 &amp; 1.4 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ \\addlinespace 5.4 &amp; 3.9 &amp; 1.7 &amp; 0.4 &amp; setosa\\\\ 4.6 &amp; 3.4 &amp; 1.4 &amp; 0.3 &amp; setosa\\\\ 5.0 &amp; 3.4 &amp; 1.5 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ 4.4 &amp; 2.9 &amp; 1.4 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ 4.9 &amp; 3.1 &amp; 1.5 &amp; 0.1 &amp; setosa\\\\ \\bottomrule \\end{tabular} Please note that when you need additional LaTeX packages such as booktabs for an R Markdown document, you have to declare these packages in YAML (see Section 6.4 for how). Depending on whether the argument booktabs is TRUE or FALSE (default), the table appearance is different. For booktabs = FALSE: Table columns are separated by vertical lines. You can explicitly remove the vertical lines via the vline argument, e.g., knitr::kable(iris, vline = \"\") (the default is vline = \"|\"). You can set this option as a global R option so you do not need to set it for every single table, e.g., options(knitr.table.vline = \"\"). The horizontal lines can be defined via arguments toprule, midrule, linesep, and bottomrule. Their default values are all \\hline. For booktabs = TRUE: There are no vertical lines in the table, but you can add these lines via the vline argument. The table only has horizontal lines for the table header and the bottom row. The default argument values are toprule = \"\\\\toprule\", midrule = \"\\\\midrule\", and bottomrule = \"\\\\bottomrule\". A line space is added to every five rows by default. This is controlled by the argument linesep, which defaults to c(\"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\\\\addlinespace\"). If you want to add a space to every three rows, you can do this: knitr::kable(iris3, format = &quot;latex&quot;, linesep = c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;\\\\addlinespace&quot;), booktabs = TRUE) \\begin{tabular}{rrrrl} \\toprule Sepal.Length &amp; Sepal.Width &amp; Petal.Length &amp; Petal.Width &amp; Species\\\\ \\midrule 5.1 &amp; 3.5 &amp; 1.4 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ 4.9 &amp; 3.0 &amp; 1.4 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ 4.7 &amp; 3.2 &amp; 1.3 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ \\addlinespace 4.6 &amp; 3.1 &amp; 1.5 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ 5.0 &amp; 3.6 &amp; 1.4 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ 5.4 &amp; 3.9 &amp; 1.7 &amp; 0.4 &amp; setosa\\\\ \\addlinespace 4.6 &amp; 3.4 &amp; 1.4 &amp; 0.3 &amp; setosa\\\\ 5.0 &amp; 3.4 &amp; 1.5 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ 4.4 &amp; 2.9 &amp; 1.4 &amp; 0.2 &amp; setosa\\\\ \\addlinespace 4.9 &amp; 3.1 &amp; 1.5 &amp; 0.1 &amp; setosa\\\\ \\bottomrule \\end{tabular} If you want to remove the line spaces altogether, you may use linesep = ''. Sometimes your table may be longer than a page. In this case, you can use the argument longtable = TRUE, which uses the LaTeX package longtable to span your table to multiple pages. Tables are center-aligned by default when they are included in a table environment (i.e., when the table has a caption). If you do not want to center a table, use the argument centering = FALSE. 10.1.11 Customize HTML tables (*) If you want to customize tables generated via knitr::kable(format = \"html\"), there is only one extra argument besides the common arguments mentioned in previous sections: table.attr. This argument allows you to add arbitrary attributes to the &lt;table&gt; tag. For example: knitr::kable(mtcars[1:2, 1:2], table.attr = &quot;class=\\&quot;striped\\&quot;&quot;, format = &quot;html&quot;) &lt;table class=&quot;striped&quot;&gt; &lt;thead&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; &lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; mpg &lt;/th&gt; &lt;th style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; cyl &lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/thead&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; Mazda RX4 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; 21 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; 6 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:left;&quot;&gt; Mazda RX4 Wag &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; 21 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=&quot;text-align:right;&quot;&gt; 6 &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; We added a class striped to the table. However, a class name is not enough to change the appearance of a table. You have to define CSS rules for the class. For example, to make a striped table that has different colors for odd and even rows, you can add a light gray background to even or odd rows: .striped tr:nth-child(even) { background: #eee; } The above CSS rule means all rows (i.e., the &lt;tr&gt; tags) with even row numbers (:nth-child(even)) that are children of an element with the striped class will have a background color #eee. A little bit of CSS can make a plain HTML table look decent. Figure 10.1 is a screenshot of an HTML table to which the following CSS rules are applied: table { margin: auto; border-top: 1px solid #666; border-bottom: 1px solid #666; } table thead th { border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; } th, td { padding: 5px; } thead, tfoot, tr:nth-child(even) { background: #eee; } FIGURE 10.1: A striped table created with HTML and CSS. "],["kableextra.html", "10.2 The kableExtra package", " 10.2 The kableExtra package The kableExtra package (Zhu 2024) is designed to extend the basic functionality of tables produced using knitr::kable() (see Section 10.1). Since knitr::kable() is simple by design (please feel free to read this as “Yihui is lazy”), it definitely has a lot of missing features that are commonly seen in other packages, and kableExtra has filled the gap perfectly. The most amazing thing about kableExtra is that most of its table features work for both HTML and PDF formats (e.g., making striped tables like the one in Figure 10.1). This package can be installed from CRAN as usual, or you may try the development version on GitHub (https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra): # install from CRAN install.packages(&quot;kableExtra&quot;) # install the development version remotes::install_github(&quot;haozhu233/kableExtra&quot;) It has extensive documentation at https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/, which provides a lot of examples on how the kable() output can be customized for either HTML or LaTeX output. We recommend that you read its documentation by yourself, and will only present a handful of examples in this section. The kableExtra package features the pipe operator, %&gt;%. You can pipe the kable() output to the styling functions of kableExtra, e.g., library(knitr) library(kableExtra) kable(iris) %&gt;% kable_styling(latex_options = &quot;striped&quot;) 10.2.1 Set the font size The function kable_styling() in kableExtra allows you to style the whole table. For example, you can specify the alignment of the table on the page, the width, and the font size of the table. Below is an example of using a smaller font size: kable(head(iris, 5), booktabs = TRUE) %&gt;% kable_styling(font_size = 8) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa 10.2.2 Style specific rows/columns The functions row_spec() and column_spec() can be used to style individual rows and columns, respectively. In the example below, we make the first row bold and italic, add a black background to the second and third rows while changing the font color to white, underline the fourth row and change its typeface, rotate the fifth row, and strike out the fifth column: kable(head(iris, 5), align = &#39;c&#39;, booktabs = TRUE) %&gt;% row_spec(1, bold = TRUE, italic = TRUE) %&gt;% row_spec(2:3, color = &#39;white&#39;, background = &#39;black&#39;) %&gt;% row_spec(4, underline = TRUE, monospace = TRUE) %&gt;% row_spec(5, angle = 45) %&gt;% column_spec(5, strikeout = TRUE) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa Similarly, you can style individual cells with the cell_spec() function. 10.2.3 Group rows/columns Rows and columns can be grouped via the functions pack_rows() and add_header_above(), respectively. You can also collapse rows via collapse_rows(), so one cell can span multiple rows. Below is an example that shows a custom table header with grouped columns: iris2 &lt;- iris[1:5, c(1, 3, 2, 4, 5)] names(iris2) &lt;- gsub(&#39;[.].+&#39;, &#39;&#39;, names(iris2)) kable(iris2, booktabs = TRUE) %&gt;% add_header_above(c(&quot;Length&quot; = 2, &quot;Width&quot; = 2, &quot; &quot; = 1)) %&gt;% add_header_above(c(&quot;Measurements&quot; = 4, &quot;More attributes&quot; = 1)) Measurements More attributes Length Width Sepal Petal Sepal Petal Species 5.1 1.4 3.5 0.2 setosa 4.9 1.4 3.0 0.2 setosa 4.7 1.3 3.2 0.2 setosa 4.6 1.5 3.1 0.2 setosa 5.0 1.4 3.6 0.2 setosa For the named vector in add_header_above(), the names are the text to be shown in the table header, and the integer values of the vector indicate how many columns a name should span, e.g., \"Length\" = 2 means Length should span two columns. Below is an example of pack_rows(). The meaning of its index argument is similar to the argument of add_header_above() as we just explained before. iris3 &lt;- iris[c(1:2, 51:54, 101:103), ] kable(iris3[, 1:4], booktabs = TRUE) %&gt;% pack_rows( index = c(&quot;setosa&quot; = 2, &quot;versicolor&quot; = 4, &quot;virginica&quot; = 3) ) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width setosa 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 versicolor 51 7.0 3.2 4.7 1.4 52 6.4 3.2 4.5 1.5 53 6.9 3.1 4.9 1.5 54 5.5 2.3 4.0 1.3 virginica 101 6.3 3.3 6.0 2.5 102 5.8 2.7 5.1 1.9 103 7.1 3.0 5.9 2.1 10.2.4 Scaling down wide tables in LaTeX There are a few features that are specific to the HTML or LaTeX output format. For example, landscape pages only make sense in LaTeX, so the landscape() function in kableExtra only works for LaTeX output. Below we show an example to scale down a table to fit the page (otherwise it would be too wide): tab &lt;- kable(tail(mtcars, 5), booktabs = TRUE) tab # original table (too wide) mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.9 1 1 5 2 Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.5 0 1 5 4 Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.5 0 1 5 6 Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.6 0 1 5 8 Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.6 1 1 4 2 tab %&gt;% kable_styling(latex_options = &quot;scale_down&quot;) mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb Lotus Europa 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.9 1 1 5 2 Ford Pantera L 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.5 0 1 5 4 Ferrari Dino 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.5 0 1 5 6 Maserati Bora 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.6 0 1 5 8 Volvo 142E 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.6 1 1 4 2 You will not see any differences in the above two tables if you are viewing the HTML version. References "],["table-other.html", "10.3 Other packages for creating tables", " 10.3 Other packages for creating tables There are many other R packages that can be used to generate tables. The main reason that I introduced kable() (Section 10.1) and kableExtra (Section 10.2) is not that they are better than other packages, but because I’m familiar with only them.14 Next I will list the packages that I’m aware of but not very familiar with. You can check them out by yourself, and decide which one fits your purpose best. flextable (Gohel and Skintzos 2025) and huxtable (Hugh-Jones 2025): If you are looking for a table package that supports the widest range of output formats, flextable and huxtable are probably the two best choices. They all support HTML, LaTeX, and Office formats, and contain most common table features (e.g., conditional formatting). More information about flextable can be found at https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/, and the documentation of huxtable is at https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/. gt (Iannone et al. 2026): Allows you to compose a table by putting together different parts of the table, such as the table header (title and subtitle), the column labels, the table body, row group labels, and the table footer. Some parts are optional. You can also format numbers and add background shading to cells. Currently gt mainly supports HTML output.15 You can find more information about it at https://gt.rstudio.com. formattable (Ren and Russell 2021): Provides some utility functions to format numbers (e.g., percent() and accounting()), and also functions to style table columns (e.g., format the text, annotate numbers with background shading or color bars, or add icons in cells). Like gt, this package also primarily supports the HTML format. You can find more information about it from its GitHub project at https://github.com/renkun-ken/formattable. DT (Xie, Cheng, et al. 2025): As its author, I think I’m familiar with this package, but I did not introduce it in a separate section because it only supports the HTML format. DT is built on top of the JavaScript library DataTables, which can turn a static table into an interactive table on an HTML page. You may sort, search, and paginate the table. DT also supports formatting the cells, works with Shiny to build interactive applications, and has included a large number of DataTables extensions (e.g., you may export the table to Excel, or interactively reorder columns). See the package repository for more information: https://github.com/rstudio/DT. reactable (Lin 2025): Similar to DT, this package also creates interactive tables based on a JavaScript library. Frankly speaking, it looks better than DT in several aspects in my eyes (such as row grouping and aggregation, and embedding HTML widgets). Had reactable existed in 2015, I would not have developed DT. That said, reactable does not contain all the features of DT, so you may read its documentation and see which one fits your purpose better: https://glin.github.io/reactable/. rhandsontable (Owen 2021): Also similar to DT, and has an Excel feel (e.g., you can edit data directly in the table). Visit https://jrowen.github.io/rhandsontable/ to learn more about it. pixiedust (Nutter 2023): Features creating tables for models (such as linear models) converted through the broom package (Robinson et al. 2026). It supports Markdown, HTML, and LaTeX output formats. Its repository is at https://github.com/nutterb/pixiedust. stargazer (Hlavac 2022): Features formatting regression models and summary statistics tables. The package is available on CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/package=stargazer. xtable (Dahl et al. 2019): Perhaps the oldest package for creating tables—the first release was made in 2000. It supports both LaTeX and HTML formats. The package is available on CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/package=xtable. I’m not going to introduce the rest of packages, but will just list them here: tables (Murdoch 2025), pander (Daróczi and Tsegelskyi 2025), tangram (Garbett 2025), ztable (Moon 2021), and condformat (Oller Moreno 2023). References "],["chunk-options.html", "Chapter 11 Chunk Options", " Chapter 11 Chunk Options As illustrated in Figure 2.1, the R package knitr plays a critical role in R Markdown. In this chapter and the next three chapters, we show some recipes related to knitr. There are more than 50 chunk options that can be used to fine-tune the behavior of knitr when processing R chunks. Please refer to the online documentation at https://yihui.org/knitr/options/ for the full list of options. In the following sections, we only show examples of applying chunk options to individual code chunks. However, please be aware of the fact that any chunk options can also be applied globally to a whole document, so you do not have to repeat the options in every single code chunk. To set chunk options globally, call knitr::opts_chunk$set() in a code chunk (usually the first one in the document), e.g., ```{r, include=FALSE} knitr::opts_chunk$set( comment = &quot;#&gt;&quot;, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 6 ) ``` "],["chunk-variable.html", "11.1 Use variables in chunk options", " 11.1 Use variables in chunk options Usually chunk options take constant values (e.g., fig.width = 6), but they can actually take values from arbitrary R expressions, no matter how simple or complicated the expressions are. A special case is a variable passed to a chunk option (note that a variable is also an R expression). For example, you can define a figure width in a variable in the beginning of a document, and use it later in other code chunks, so you will be able to easily change the width in the future: ```{r} my_width &lt;- 7 ``` ```{r, fig.width=my_width} plot(cars) ``` Below is an example of using an if-else statement in a chunk option: ```{r} fig_small &lt;- FALSE # change to TRUE for larger figures width_small &lt;- 4 width_large &lt;- 8 ``` ```{r, fig.width=if (fig_small) width_small else width_large} plot(cars) ``` And we have one more example below in which we evaluate (i.e., execute) a code chunk only if a required package is available: ```{r, eval=require(&#39;leaflet&#39;)} library(leaflet) leaflet() %&gt;% addTiles() ``` In case you do not know it, require('package') returns TRUE if the package is available (and FALSE if not). "],["opts-error.html", "11.2 Do not stop on error", " 11.2 Do not stop on error Sometimes you may want to show errors on purpose (e.g., in an R tutorial). By default, errors in the code chunks of an Rmd document will halt R. If you want to show the errors without stopping R, you may use the chunk option error = TRUE, e.g., ```{r, error=TRUE} 1 + &quot;a&quot; ``` You will see the error message in the output document after you compile the Rmd document: Error in `1 + &quot;a&quot;`: ! non-numeric argument to binary operator In R Markdown, error = FALSE is the default, which means R should stop on error when running the code chunks. "],["dev-vector.html", "11.3 Multiple graphical output formats for the same plot", " 11.3 Multiple graphical output formats for the same plot In most cases, you may want one image format for one plot, such as png or pdf. The image format is controlled by the chunk option dev (i.e., the graphical device to render the plots). This option can take a vector of device names, e.g., ```{r, dev=c(&#39;png&#39;, &#39;pdf&#39;, &#39;svg&#39;, &#39;tiff&#39;)} plot(cars) ``` Only the first format is used in the output document, but the images corresponding to the rest of formats are also generated. This can be useful when you are required to submit figures of different formats additionally (e.g., you have shown a png figure in the report but the tiff format of the same figure is also required). Note that by default, plot files are typically deleted after the output document is rendered. To preserve these files, please see Section 16.5. "],["cache.html", "11.4 Cache time-consuming code chunks", " 11.4 Cache time-consuming code chunks When a code chunk is time-consuming to run, you may consider caching it via the chunk option cache = TRUE. When the cache is turned on, knitr will skip the execution of this code chunk if it has been executed before and nothing in the code chunk has changed since then. When you modify the code chunk (e.g., revise the code or the chunk options), the previous cache will be automatically invalidated, and knitr will cache the chunk again. For a cached code chunk, its output and objects will be automatically loaded from the previous run, as if the chunk were executed again. Caching is often helpful when loading results is much faster than computing the results. However, there is no free lunch. Depending on your use case, you may need to learn more about how caching (especially cache invalidation) works, so you can take full advantage of it without confusing yourself as to why sometimes knitr invalidates your cache too often and sometimes there is not enough invalidation. The most appropriate use case of caching is to save and reload R objects that take too long to compute in a code chunk, and the code does not have any side effects, such as changing global R options via options() (such changes will not be cached). If a code chunk has side effects, we recommend that you do not cache it. As we briefly mentioned earlier, the cache depends on chunk options. If you change any chunk options (except the option include), the cache will be invalidated. This feature can be used to solve a common problem. That is, when you read an external data file, you may want to invalidate the cache when the data file is updated. Simply using cache = TRUE is not enough: ```{r import-data, cache=TRUE} d &lt;- read.csv(&#39;my-precious.csv&#39;) ``` You have to let knitr know if the data file has been changed. One way to do it is to add another chunk option cache.extra = file.mtime('my-precious.csv') or more rigorously, cache.extra = tools::md5sum('my-precious.csv'). The former means if the modification time of the file has been changed, we need to invalidate the cache. The latter means if the content of the file has been modified, we update the cache. Note that cache.extra is not a built-in knitr chunk option. You can use any other name for this option, as long as it does not conflict with built-in option names. Similarly, you can associate the cache with other information such as the R version (cache.extra = getRversion()), the date (cache.extra = Sys.Date()), or your operating system (cache.extra = Sys.info()[['sysname']]), so the cache can be properly invalidated when these conditions change. We do not recommend that you set the chunk option cache = TRUE globally in a document. Caching can be fairly tricky. Instead, we recommend that you enable caching only on individual code chunks that are surely time-consuming and do not have side effects. If you are not happy with knitr’s design for caching, you can certainly cache objects by yourself. Below is a quick example: if (file.exists(&quot;results.rds&quot;)) { res &lt;- readRDS(&quot;results.rds&quot;) } else { res &lt;- compute_it() # a time-consuming function saveRDS(res, &quot;results.rds&quot;) } In this case, the only (and also simple) way to invalidate the cache is to delete the file results.rds. If you like this simple caching mechanism, you may use the function xfun::cache_rds() introduced in Section 14.9. "],["cache-path.html", "11.5 Cache a code chunk for multiple output formats", " 11.5 Cache a code chunk for multiple output formats When caching is turned on via the chunk option cache = TRUE, knitr will write R objects generated in a code chunk to a cache database, so they can be reloaded the next time. The path to the cache database is determined by the chunk option cache.path. By default, R Markdown uses different cache paths for different output formats, which means a time-consuming code chunk will be fully executed for each output format. This may be inconvenient, but there is a reason for this default behavior: the output of a code chunk can be dependent on the specific output format. For example, when you generate a plot, the output for the plot could be Markdown code like ![text](path/to/image.png) when the output format is word_document, or HTML code like &lt;img src=\"path/to/image.png\" /&gt; when the output format is html_document. When a code chunk does not have any side effects (such as plots), it is safe to use the same cache database for all output formats, which can save you time. For example, when you read a large data object or run a time-consuming model, the result does not depend on the output format, so you can use the same cache database. You can specify the path to the database via the chunk option cache.path on a code chunk, e.g., ```{r important-computing, cache=TRUE, cache.path=&quot;cache/&quot;} ``` By default, cache.path = \"INPUT_cache/FORMAT/\" in R Markdown, where INPUT is the input filename, and FORMAT is the output format name (e.g., html, latex, or docx). "],["cache-lazy.html", "11.6 Cache large objects", " 11.6 Cache large objects When the chunk option cache = TRUE, cached objects will be lazy-loaded into the R session, which means an object will not be read from the cache database until it is actually used in the code. This can save you some memory when not all objects are used later in the document. For example, if you read a large data object but only use a subset in the subsequent analysis, the original data object will not be loaded from the cache database: ```{r, read-data, cache=TRUE} full &lt;- read.csv(&quot;HUGE.csv&quot;) rows &lt;- subset(full, price &gt; 100) # next we only use `rows` ``` ```{r} plot(rows) ``` However, when an object is too large, you may run into an error like this: Error in lazyLoadDBinsertVariable(vars[i], ... long vectors not supported yet: ... Execution halted If this problem occurs, you can try to turn off the lazy-loading via the chunk option cache.lazy = FALSE. All objects in this chunk will be immediately loaded into memory. "],["hide-one.html", "11.7 Hide code, text output, messages, or plots", " 11.7 Hide code, text output, messages, or plots By default, knitr displays all possible output from a code chunk, including the source code, text output, messages, warnings, and plots. You can hide them individually using the corresponding chunk options. Hide source code: ```{r, echo=FALSE} 1 + 1 ``` Hide text output (you can also use `results = FALSE`): ```{r, results=&#39;hide&#39;} print(&quot;You will not see the text output.&quot;) ``` Hide messages: ```{r, message=FALSE} message(&quot;You will not see the message.&quot;) ``` Hide warning messages: ```{r, warning=FALSE} # this will generate a warning but it will be suppressed 1:2 + 1:3 ``` Hide plots: ```{r, fig.show=&#39;hide&#39;} plot(cars) ``` Note that the plot will be generated in the above chunk. It is just not displayed in the output. One frequently asked question about knitr is how to hide package loading messages. For example, when you library(tidyverse) or library(ggplot2), you may see some loading messages. Such messages can also be suppressed by the chunk option message = FALSE. You can also selectively show or hide these elements by indexing them. In the following example, we only show the fourth and fifth expressions of the R source code (note that a comment counts as one expression), the first two messages, and the second and third warnings: ```{r, echo=c(4, 5), message=c(1, 2), warning=2:3} # one way to generate random N(0, 1) numbers x &lt;- qnorm(runif(10)) # but we can just use rnorm() in practice x &lt;- rnorm(10) x for (i in 1:5) message(&#39;Here is the message &#39;, i) for (i in 1:5) warning(&#39;Here is the warning &#39;, i) ``` You can use negative indices, too. For example, echo = -2 means to exclude the second expression of the source code in the output. Similarly, you can choose which plots to show or hide by using indices for the fig.keep option. For example, fig.keep = 1:2 means to keep the first two plots. There are a few shortcuts for this option: fig.keep = \"first\" will only keep the first plot, fig.keep = \"last\" only keeps the last plot, and fig.keep = \"none\" discards all plots. Note that the two options fig.keep = \"none\" and fig.show = \"hide\" are different: the latter will generate plots but only hide them, and the former will not generate plot files at all. For source code blocks in the html_document output, if you do not want to completely omit them (echo = FALSE), you may see Section 7.5 for how to fold them on the page, and allow users to unfold them by clicking the unfolding buttons. "],["hide-all.html", "11.8 Hide everything from a chunk", " 11.8 Hide everything from a chunk Sometimes we may want to execute a code chunk without showing any output at all. Instead of using separate options mentioned in Section 11.7, we can suppress the entire output of the code chunk using a single option include = FALSE, e.g., ```{r, include=FALSE} # any R code here ``` With include=FALSE, the code chunk will be evaluated (unless eval=FALSE), but the output will be completely suppressed—you will not see any code, text output, messages, or plots. "],["opts-collapse.html", "11.9 Collapse text output blocks into source blocks", " 11.9 Collapse text output blocks into source blocks If you feel there is too much spacing between text output blocks and source code blocks in the output, you may consider collapsing the text output into the source blocks with the chunk option collapse = TRUE.

The tidy_source() can reformat the code in several aspects, such as adding spaces around most operators, indenting the code properly, and replacing the assignment operator = with &lt;-. The chunk option tidy.opts can be a list of arguments to be passed to formatR::tidy_source(), e.g., ```{r, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(arrow=TRUE, indent=2)} # messy R code... 1+ 1 x=1:10#some users prefer &#39;&lt;-&#39; as the assignment operator if(TRUE){ print(&#39;Hello world!&#39;) # indent by 2 spaces } ``` The output: # messy R code... 1 + 1 x &lt;- 1:10 #some users prefer &#39;&lt;-&#39; as the assignment operator if (TRUE) { print(&quot;Hello world!&quot;) # indent by 2 spaces } In Section 5.3, we mentioned how to control the width of text output. If you want to control the width of the source code, you may try the width.cutoff argument when tidy = TRUE, e.g., ```{r, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=50)} # a long expression 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+ 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 ``` The output: # a long expression 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 Please read the help page ?formatR::tidy_source to know the possible arguments, and also see https://yihui.org/formatR/ for examples and limitations of this function. Alternatively, you may use the styler package (Müller, Walthert, and Patil 2025) to reformat your R code if you set the chunk option tidy = 'styler'. The R code will be formatted with the function styler::style_text(). The styler package has richer features than formatR. For example, it can preserve alignment and works with tidyverse syntax such as %&gt;%, !! or {{. The chunk option tidy.opts can also be used to pass additional arguments to styler::style_text(), e.g., ```{r, tidy=&#39;styler&#39;, tidy.opts=list(strict=FALSE)} # align the assignment operators a &lt;- 1#one variable abc &lt;- 2#another variable ``` By default, tidy = FALSE and your R code will not be reformatted. References "],["results-asis.html", "11.11 Output text as raw Markdown content (*)", " 11.11 Output text as raw Markdown content (*) By default, text output from code chunks will be written out verbatim with two leading hashes (see Section 11.12). The text is verbatim because knitr puts it in fenced code blocks. For example, the raw output of the code 1:5 from knitr is: ``` ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 ``` Sometimes you may not want verbatim text output, but treat text output as Markdown content instead. For example, you may want to write out a section header with cat('# This is a header'), but the raw output is: ``` ## # This is a header ``` You do not want the text to be in a fenced code block (or the leading hashes). That is, you want the raw output to be exactly the character string passed to cat(): # This is a header The solution to this problem is the chunk option results = 'asis'. This option tells knitr not to wrap your text output in verbatim code blocks, but treat it “as is.” This can be particularly useful when you want to generate content dynamically from R code. For example, you may generate the list of column names of the iris data from the following code chunk with the option results = 'asis': cat(paste0(&quot;- `&quot;, names(iris), &quot;`&quot;), sep = &quot;\\n&quot;) Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species The hyphen (-) is the syntax for unordered lists in Markdown. The backticks are optional. You can see the verbatim output of the above chunk without the results = 'asis' option: cat(paste0(&quot;- `&quot;, names(iris), &quot;`&quot;), sep = &quot;\\n&quot;) - `Sepal.Length` - `Sepal.Width` - `Petal.Length` - `Petal.Width` - `Species` Below is a full example that shows how you can generate section headers, paragraphs, and plots in a for-loop for all columns of the mtcars data: --- title: Generate content programmatically --- With the chunk option `results = &#39;asis&#39;`, you can write out text as raw Markdown content, which can also be mixed with plots. ```{r, mtcars-plots, results=&#39;asis&#39;} for (i in names(mtcars)) { cat(&#39;\\n\\n# Summary of the variable `&#39;, i, &#39;`\\n\\n&#39;) x &lt;- mtcars[, i] if (length(unique(x)) &lt;= 6) { cat(&#39;`&#39;, i, &#39;` is a categorical variable.\\n\\n&#39;) plot(table(x), xlab = i, ylab = &#39;Frequency&#39;, lwd = 10) } else { cat(&#39;Histogram for the continuous variable `&#39;, i, &#39;`.\\n\\n&#39;) hist(x, xlab = i, main = &#39;&#39;) } } ``` Please note that we added line breaks (\\n) excessively in the code. That is because we want different elements to be separated clearly in the Markdown content. It is harmless to use an excessive number of line breaks between different elements, whereas it can be problematic if there are not enough line breaks. For example, there is much ambiguity in the Markdown text below: # Is this a header? Is this a paragraph or a part of the header? ![How about this image?](foo.png) # How about this line? With more empty lines (which could be generated by cat('\\n')), the ambiguity will be gone: # Yes, a header! And definitely a paragraph. ![An image here.](foo.png) # Absolutely another header The cat() function is not the only function that can generate text output. Another commonly used function is print(). Please note that print() is often implicitly called to print objects, which is why you see output after typing out an object or value in the R console. For example, when you type 1:5 in the R console and hit the Enter key, you see the output because R actually called print(1:5) implicitly. This can be highly confusing when you fail to generate output inside an expression (such as a for-loop) with objects or values that would otherwise be correctly printed if they were typed in the R console. This topic is quite technical, and I have written the blog post “The Ghost Printer behind Top-level R Expressions” to explain it. If you are not interested in the technical details, just remember this rule: if you do not see output from a for-loop, you should probably print objects explicitly with the print() function. "],["opts-comment.html", "11.12 Remove leading hashes in text output", " 11.12 Remove leading hashes in text output By default, R code output will have two hashes ## inserted in front of the text output. We can alter this behavior through the comment chunk option, which defaults to a character string \"##\". We can use an empty string if we want to remove the hashes. For example: ```{r, comment=&quot;&quot;} 1:100 ``` Of course, you can use any other character values, e.g., comment = \"#&gt;\". Why does the comment option default to hashes? That is because # indicates comments in R. When the text output is commented out, it will be easier for you to copy all the code from a code chunk in a report and run it by yourself, without worrying about the fact that text output is not R code. For example, in the code chunk below, you can copy all four lines of text and run them safely as R code: 1 + 1 ## [1] 2 2 + 2 ## [1] 4 If you remove the hashes via comment = \"\", it will not be easy for you to run all the code, because if you copy the four lines, you will have to manually remove the second and fourth lines: 1 + 1 [1] 2 2 + 2 [1] 4 One argument in favor of comment = \"\" is that it makes the text output look familiar to R console users. In the R console, you do not see hashes in the beginning of lines of text output. If you want to truly mimic the behavior of the R console, you can actually use comment = \"\" in conjunction with prompt = TRUE, e.g., ```{r, comment=&quot;&quot;, prompt=TRUE} 1 + 1 if (TRUE) { 2 + 2 } ``` The output should look fairly familiar to you if you have ever typed and run code in the R console, since the source code contains the prompt character &gt; and the continuation character +: &gt; 1 + 1 [1] 2 &gt; if (TRUE) { + 2 + 2 + } [1] 4 "],["attr-output.html", "11.13 Add attributes to text output blocks (*)", " 11.13 Add attributes to text output blocks (*) In Section 7.3, we showed some examples of styling source and text output blocks based on the chunk options class.source and class.output. Actually, there is a wider range of similar options in knitr, such as class.message, class.warning, and class.error. These options can be used to add class names to the corresponding text output blocks, e.g., class.error adds classes to error messages when the chunk option error = TRUE (see Section 11.2). The most common application of these options may be styling the output blocks with CSS rules defined according to the class names, as demonstrated by the examples in Section 7.3. Typically, a text output block is essentially a fenced code block, and its Markdown source looks like this: ```{.className} lines of output ``` When the output format is HTML, it is usually16 converted to: &lt;pre class=&quot;className&quot;&gt; &lt;code&gt;lines of output&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; The class.* options control the class attribute of the &lt;pre&gt; element, which is the container of the text output blocks that we mentioned above. In fact, the class is only one of the possible attributes of the &lt;pre&gt; element in HTML. An HTML element may have many other attributes, such as the width, height, and style, etc. The chunk options attr.*, including attr.source, attr.output, attr.message, attr.warning, and attr.error, allow you to add arbitrary attributes to the text output blocks. For example, with attr.source = 'style=\"background: pink;\"', you may change the background color of source blocks to pink. The corresponding fenced code block will be: ```{style=&quot;background: pink;&quot;} ... ``` And the HTML output will be: &lt;pre style=&quot;background: pink;&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/pre&gt; You can find more examples in Section 5.7 and Section 12.3. As a technical note, the chunk options class.* are just special cases of attr.*, e.g., class.source = 'numberLines' is equivalent to attr.source = '.numberLines' (note the leading dot here), but attr.source can take arbitrary attribute values, e.g., attr.source = c('.numberLines', 'startFrom=\"11\"'). These options are mostly useful to HTML output. There are cases in which the attributes may be useful to other output formats, but these cases are relatively rare. The attributes need to be supported by either Pandoc (such as the .numberLines attribute, which works for both HTML and LaTeX output), or a third-party package (usually via a Lua filter, as introduced in Section 4.20). It could also be converted to &lt;div class=\"className\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;. You may view the source of the HTML output document to make sure.↩︎ "],["fig-process.html", "11.14 Post-process plots (*)", " 11.14 Post-process plots (*) After a plot is generated from a code chunk, you can post-process the plot file via the chunk option fig.process, which should be a function that takes the file path as the input argument and returns a path to the processed plot file. This function can have an optional second argument options, which is a list of the current chunk options. Below we show an example of adding an R logo to a plot using the extremely powerful magick package (Ooms 2025). If you are not familiar with this package, we recommend that you read its online documentation or package vignette, which contains lots of examples. First, we define a function add_logo(): add_logo &lt;- function(path, options) { # the plot created from the code chunk img &lt;- magick::image_read(path) # the R logo logo &lt;- file.path(R.home(&quot;doc&quot;), &quot;html&quot;, &quot;logo.jpg&quot;) logo &lt;- magick::image_read(logo) # the default gravity is northwest, and users can # change it via the chunk option magick.gravity if (is.null(g &lt;- options$magick.gravity)) g &lt;- &quot;northwest&quot; # add the logo to the plot img &lt;- magick::image_composite(img, logo, gravity = g) # write out the new image magick::image_write(img, path) path } Basically the function takes the path of an R plot, adds an R logo to it, and saves the new plot to the original path. By default, the logo is added to the upper-left corner (northwest) of the plot, but users can customize the location via the custom chunk option magick.gravity (this option name can be arbitrary). Now we apply the above processing function to the code chunk below with chunk options fig.process = add_logo and magick.gravity = \"northeast\", so the logo is added to the upper-right corner. See Figure 11.1 for the actual output. par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1)) hist(faithful$eruptions, breaks = 30, main = &quot;&quot;, col = &quot;gray&quot;, border = &quot;white&quot;) FIGURE 11.1: Add the R logo to a plot via the chunk option fig.process. After you get more familiar with the magick package, you may come up with more creative and useful ideas to post-process your R plots. Finally, we show one more application of the fig.process option. The pdf2png() function below converts a PDF image to PNG. In Section 11.15, we have an example of using the tikz graphical device to generate plots. The problem is that this device generates PDF plots, which will not work for non-LaTeX output documents. With the chunk options dev = \"tikz\" and fig.process = pdf2png, we can show the PNG version of the plot in Figure 11.2. pdf2png &lt;- function(path) { # only do the conversion for non-LaTeX output if (knitr::is_latex_output()) return(path) path2 &lt;- xfun::with_ext(path, &quot;png&quot;) img &lt;- magick::image_read_pdf(path) magick::image_write(img, path2, format = &quot;png&quot;) path2 } References "],["graphical-device.html", "11.15 High-quality graphics (*)", " 11.15 High-quality graphics (*) The rmarkdown package has set reasonable default graphical devices for different output formats. For example, HTML output formats use the png() device, so knitr will generate PNG plot files, and PDF output formats use the pdf() device, etc. If you are not satisfied with the quality of the default graphical devices, you can change them via the chunk option dev. All possible devices supported by knitr are: \"bmp\", \"postscript\", \"pdf\", \"png\", \"svg\", \"jpeg\", \"pictex\", \"tiff\", \"win.metafile\", \"cairo_pdf\", \"cairo_ps\", \"quartz_pdf\", \"quartz_png\", \"quartz_jpeg\", \"quartz_tiff\", \"quartz_gif\", \"quartz_psd\", \"quartz_bmp\", \"CairoJPEG\", \"CairoPNG\", \"CairoPS\", \"CairoPDF\", \"CairoSVG\", \"CairoTIFF\", \"svglite\", \"gridSVG\", \"ragg_png\", and \"tikz\". Usually, a graphical device name is also a function name. If you want to know more about a device, you can read the R help page. For example, you can type ?svg in the R console to know the details about the svg device, which is included in base R. Note that the quartz_XXX devices are based on the quartz() function, and they are only available on macOS. The CairoXXX devices are from the add-on R package Cairo (Urbanek and Horner 2025), the svglite device is from the svglite package (Wickham, Henry, et al. 2025), and tikz is a device in the tikzDevice package (Sharpsteen and Bracken 2023). If you want to use devices from an add-on package, you have to install the package first. Usually, vector graphics have higher quality than raster graphics, and you can scale vector graphics without loss of quality. For HTML output, you may consider using dev = \"svg\" or dev = \"svglite\" for SVG plots. Note that SVG is a vector graphics format, and the default png device produces a raster graphics format. For PDF output, if you are really picky about the typeface in your plots, you may use dev = \"tikz\", because it offers native support for LaTeX, which means all elements in a plot, including text and symbols, are rendered in high quality through LaTeX. Figure 11.2 shows an example of writing LaTeX math expressions in an R plot rendered with the chunk option dev = \"tikz\". par(mar = c(4, 4, 2, .1)) curve(dnorm, -3, 3, xlab = &#39;$x$&#39;, ylab = &#39;$\\\\phi(x)$&#39;, main = &#39;The density function of $N(0, 1)$&#39;) text(-1, .2, cex = 3, col = &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;$\\\\phi(x)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}}e^{\\\\frac{-x^2}{2}}$&#39;) FIGURE 11.2: A plot rendered via the tikz device. Note that base R actually supports math expressions, but they are not rendered via LaTeX (see ?plotmath for details). There are several advanced options to tune the typesetting details of the tikz device. You may see ?tikzDevice::tikz for the possibilities. For example, if your plot contains multibyte characters, you may want to set the option: options(tikzDefaultEngine = &quot;xetex&quot;) That is because xetex is usually better than the default engine pdftex in processing multibyte characters in LaTeX documents. There are two major disadvantages of the tikz device. First, it requires a LaTeX installation, but this may not be too bad (see Section 1.2). You also need a few LaTeX packages, which can be easily installed if you are using TinyTeX: tinytex::tlmgr_install(c(&quot;pgf&quot;, &quot;preview&quot;, &quot;xcolor&quot;)) Second, it is often significantly slower to render the plots, because this device generates a LaTeX file and has to compile it to PDF. If you feel the code chunk is time-consuming, you may enable caching by the chunk option cache = TRUE (see Section 11.4). For Figure 11.2, we also used the chunk option fig.process = pdf2png, where the function pdf2png is defined in Section 11.14 to convert the PDF plot to PNG when the output format is not LaTeX. Without the conversion, you may not be able to view the PDF plot in the online version of this book in the web browser. References "],["low-plots.html", "11.16 Step-by-step plots with low-level plotting functions (*)", " 11.16 Step-by-step plots with low-level plotting functions (*) For R graphics, there are two types of plotting functions: high-level plotting functions create new plots, and low-level functions add elements to existing plots. You may see Chapter 12 (“Graphical procedures”) of the R manual An Introduction to R for more information. By default, knitr does not show the intermediate plots when a series of low-level plotting functions are used to modify a previous plot. Only the last plot on which all low-level plotting changes have been made is shown. It can be useful to show the intermediate plots, especially for teaching purposes. You can set the chunk option fig.keep = 'low' to keep low-level plotting changes. For example, Figure 11.3 and Figure 11.4 are from a single code chunk with the chunk option fig.keep = 'low', although they appear to be from two code chunks. We also assigned different figure captions to them with the chunk option fig.cap = c('A scatterplot ...', 'Adding a regression line...'). par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.1, 0.1)) plot(cars) FIGURE 11.3: A scatterplot of the cars data. fit &lt;- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars) abline(fit) FIGURE 11.4: Adding a regression line to an existing scatterplot.

"],["opts-render.html", "11.17 Customize the printing of objects in chunks (*)", " 11.17 Customize the printing of objects in chunks (*) By default, objects in code chunks are printed through the knitr::knit_print() function, which is by and large just print() in base R. The knit_print() function is an S3 generic function, which means you can extend it by yourself by registering S3 methods on it. The following is an example that shows how to automatically print data frames as tables via knitr::kable(): --- title: Use a custom `knit_print` method to print data frames --- First, we define a `knit_print` method, and register it: ```{r} knit_print.data.frame = function(x, ...) { res = paste(c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, knitr::kable(x)), collapse = &quot;\\n&quot;) knitr::asis_output(res) } registerS3method( &quot;knit_print&quot;, &quot;data.frame&quot;, knit_print.data.frame, envir = asNamespace(&quot;knitr&quot;) ) ``` Now we can test this custom printing method on data frames. Note that you no longer need to call `knitr::kable()` explicitly. ```{r} head(iris) ``` ```{r} head(mtcars) ``` You can learn more about the knit_print() function in the knitr package vignette: vignette(&quot;knit_print&quot;, package = &quot;knitr&quot;) The printr package (Xie 2023b) has provided a few S3 methods to automatically print R objects as tables if possible. All you need is library(printr) in an R code chunk, and all methods will be automatically registered. If you find this technique too advanced for you, some R Markdown output formats such as html_document and pdf_document also provide an option df_print, which allows you to customize the printing behavior of data frames. For example, if you want to print data frames as tables via knitr::kable(), you may set the option: --- output: html_document: df_print: kable --- Please see the help pages of the output format functions (e.g., ?rmarkdown::html_document) to determine whether an output format supports the df_print option and, if so, what the possible values are. In fact, you can completely replace the printing function knit_print() through the chunk option render, which can take any function to print objects. For example, if you want to print objects using the pander package, you may set the chunk option render to the function pander::pander(): ```{r, render=pander::pander} iris ``` The render option gives you complete freedom on how to print your R objects. References "],["option-hooks.html", "11.18 Option hooks (*)", " 11.18 Option hooks (*) Sometimes you may want to change certain chunk options dynamically according to the values of other chunk options. You may use the object opts_hooks to set up an option hook to do it. An option hook is a function associated with the option and to be executed when a corresponding chunk option is not NULL. This function takes the list of options for the current chunk as the input argument, and should return the (potentially modified) list. For example, we can tweak the fig.width option so that it is always no smaller than fig.height: knitr::opts_hooks$set(fig.width = function(options) { if (options$fig.width &lt; options$fig.height) { options$fig.width &lt;- options$fig.height } options }) Because fig.width will never be NULL, this hook function is always executed before a code chunk to update its chunk options. For the code chunk below, the actual value of fig.width will be 6 instead of the initial 5 if the above option hook has been set up: ```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 6} plot(1:10) ``` As another example, we rewrite the last example in Section 11.12 so we can use a single chunk option console = TRUE to imply comment = \"\" and prompt = TRUE. Note that console is not a built-in knitr chunk option but a custom and arbitrary option name instead. Its default value will be NULL. Below is a full example: ```{r, include=FALSE} knitr::opts_hooks$set(console = function(options) { if (isTRUE(options$console)) { options$comment &lt;- &#39;&#39;; options$prompt &lt;- TRUE } options }) ``` Default output: ```{r} 1 + 1 if (TRUE) { 2 + 2 } ``` Output with `console = TRUE`: ```{r, console=TRUE} 1 + 1 if (TRUE) { 2 + 2 } ``` The third example is about how to automatically add line numbers to any output blocks, including source code blocks, text output, messages, warnings, and errors. We have mentioned in Section 5.7 how to use chunk options such as attr.source and attr.output to add line numbers. Here we want to use a single chunk option (numberLines in this example) to control the blocks to which we want to add line numbers. knitr::opts_hooks$set( numberLines = function(options) { attrs &lt;- paste0(&quot;attr.&quot;, options$numberLines) options[attrs] &lt;- lapply(options[attrs], c, &quot;.numberLines&quot;) options } ) knitr::opts_chunk$set( numberLines = c( &quot;source&quot;, &quot;output&quot;, &quot;message&quot;, &quot;warning&quot;, &quot;error&quot; ) ) Basically, the option hook numberLines appends the attribute .numberLines to output blocks, and the chunk option numberLines set via opts_chunk$set() makes sure that the option hook will be executed. With the above setup, you can use the chunk option numberLines on a code chunk to decide which of its output blocks will have line numbers, e.g., numberLines = c('source', 'output'). Specifying numberLines = NULL removes line numbers completely. You may wonder how this approach differs from setting the chunk options directly, e.g., just knitr::opts_chunk$set(attr.source = '.numberLines') like we did in Section 5.7. The advantage of using the option hooks here is that they only append the attribute .numberLines to chunk options, which means they will not override existing chunk option values, e.g., the source code block of the chunk below will be numbered (with the above setup), and the numbers start from the second line: ```{r, attr.source=&#39;startFrom=&quot;2&quot;&#39;} # this comment line will not be numbered 1 + 1 ``` It is equivalent to: ```{r, attr.source=c(&#39;startFrom=&quot;2&quot;&#39;, &#39;.numberLines&#39;} # this comment line will not be numbered 1 + 1 ``` "],["output-hooks.html", "Chapter 12 Output Hooks (*)", " Chapter 12 Output Hooks (*) With the knitr package, you have control over every piece of output from your code chunks, such as source code, text output, messages, and plots. The control is achieved through “output hooks.” Output hooks are a series of functions that take a piece of output as the input (typically a character vector), and return a character vector to be written to the output document. This may not be easy to understand for now, but hopefully you can see the idea more clearly with a small example below explaining how the output of a simple code chunk is rendered through knitr’s output hooks. Consider this code chunk with one line of code: ```{r} 1 + 1 ``` After knitr evaluates the code chunk, it gets two output elements, and both are stored as character strings: the source code \"1 + 1\", and the text output \"[1] 2\". These character strings will be further processed by chunk hooks for the desired output format. For example, for Markdown documents, knitr will wrap the source code in a fenced code block with a language name. This is done through the source hook, which more or less looks like this function: # for the above case, `x` is a character string &#39;1 + # 1&#39; function(x, options) { # the little &#39;r&#39; here indicates the language name paste(c(&quot;```r&quot;, x, &quot;```&quot;), collapse = &quot;\\n&quot;) } Similarly, the text output is processed by the output hook that looks like this function: function(x, options) { paste(c(&quot;```&quot;, x, &quot;```&quot;), collapse = &quot;\\n&quot;) } So the final output of the above code chunk is: ```r 1 + 1 ``` ``` [1] 2 ``` The actual hooks are more complicated than the two functions above, but the idea is the same. You may obtain the actual hooks from the object knit_hooks via the get() method, e.g., # for meaningful output, the code below should be # executed *inside* a code chunk of a knitr document knitr::knit_hooks$get(&quot;source&quot;) knitr::knit_hooks$get(&quot;output&quot;) # or knitr::knit_hooks$get(c(&#39;source&#39;, &#39;output&#39;)) Unless you are truly interested in making contributions to the knitr package, we do not recommend that you read the source code of these built-in hooks. If you are interested, this code can be found in the scripts named in the form hooks-*.R at https://github.com/yihui/knitr/tree/master/R (e.g., hooks-md.R contains hooks for R Markdown documents). As a knitr user, it usually suffices if you know how to create custom output hooks by taking advantage of the built-in hooks. You will learn that in several examples in this chapter, and we show the basic idea below. A custom output hook is registered through the set() method of knit_hooks. Because this method will override the existing default hook, we recommend that you save a copy of an existing hook, process the output elements in your own way, and pass the results to the default hook. The usual syntax is: # using local() is optional here (we just want to # avoid creating unnecessary global variables like # `hook_old`) local({ hook_old &lt;- knitr::knit_hooks$get(&quot;NAME&quot;) # save the old hook knitr::knit_hooks$set(NAME = function(x, options) { # now do whatever you want to do with x, and pass # the new x to the old hook hook_old(x, options) }) }) Here, NAME is the name of the hook, which can be one of the following values: source: processing the source code. output: processing text output. warning: processing warnings (usually from warning()). message: processing messages (usually from message()). error: processing error messages (usually from stop()). plot: processing plot file paths. inline: processing output from inline R expressions. chunk: processing output from the whole chunk. document: processing the whole document. The meaning of the argument x in the hook functions is explained in the above list. For the options argument of a hook, it denotes the chunk options (as a list) for the current code chunk. For example, if you set foo = TRUE on a chunk, you can obtain its value via options$foo in the hook. The options argument is not available to the inline and document hooks. Output hooks give you the ultimate control over every single piece of your chunk and document output. Compared with chunk options, which often have predefined purposes, output hooks can be much more powerful since they are user-defined functions, and you can do anything you want in functions. "],["hook-hide.html", "12.1 Redact source code", " 12.1 Redact source code Sometimes we may not want to fully display our source code in the report. For example, you may have a password in a certain line of code. We mentioned in Section 11.7 that you can use the chunk option echo to select which expressions in the R code to display (e.g., show the second expression via echo = 2). In this section, we provide a more flexible method that does not require you to specify the indices of expressions. The basic idea is that you add a special comment to the code (e.g., # SECRET!!). When this comment is detected in a line of code, you omit that line. Below is a full example using the source hook: --- title: Using the `source` hook to hide certain lines of code --- First, we set up a `source` hook to exclude the lines of code that contain the string `# SECRET!!` at the end. ```{r, include=FALSE} local({ hook_source &lt;- knitr::knit_hooks$get(&#39;source&#39;) knitr::knit_hooks$set(source = function(x, options) { x &lt;- x[!grepl(&#39;# SECRET!!$&#39;, x)] hook_source(x, options) }) }) ``` Now we can test the new hook. When you knit this document, you will not see the lines with the special comment `# SECRET!!`. ```{r} 1 + 1 # normal code to be displayed # please use your real username and password auth &lt;- httr::authenticate(&quot;user&quot;, &quot;passwd&quot;) auth &lt;- httr::authenticate(&quot;yihui&quot;, &quot;horsebattery&quot;) # SECRET!! httr::GET(&quot;http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd&quot;, auth) ``` The key part in the above source hook is this line, which matches the trailing comment # SECRET!! in the source code vector x via grepl() and exclude the matches: x &lt;- x[!grepl(&quot;# SECRET!!$&quot;, x)] Precisely speaking, the above hook will exclude whole expressions containing the trailing comment # SECRET!!, instead of individual lines, because x is actually a vector of R expressions. For example, for the code chunk below: 1 + 1 if (TRUE) { # SECRET!! 1:10 } The value of x in the source hook is: c(&quot;1 + 1&quot;, &quot;if (TRUE) { # SECRET!!\\n 1:10\\n}&quot;) If you want to hide lines instead of expressions of R code, you will have to split x into individual lines. You may consider using the function xfun::split_lines(). The body of the hook function will be: x &lt;- xfun::split_lines(x) # split into individual lines x &lt;- x[!grepl(&quot;# SECRET!!$&quot;, x)] x &lt;- paste(x, collapse = &quot;\\n&quot;) # combine into a single string hook_source(x, options) This example shows you how to manipulate the source code string, and grepl() is certainly not the only choice of string manipulation. In Section 12.2, we will show another example. "],["hook-number.html", "12.2 Add line numbers to source code", " 12.2 Add line numbers to source code In this section, we show an example of defining a source hook to add line numbers as comments to the source code. For example, for this code chunk: ```{r} if (TRUE) { x &lt;- 1:10 x + 1 } ``` We want the output to be: if (TRUE) { # 1 x &lt;- 1:10 # 2 x + 1 # 3 } # 4 The full example is below: --- title: Add line numbers to source code --- We set up a `source` hook to add line numbers to the source code. The numbers appear in comments at the end of each line. ```{r, include=FALSE} local({ hook_source &lt;- knitr::knit_hooks$get(&#39;source&#39;) knitr::knit_hooks$set(source = function(x, options) { x &lt;- xfun::split_lines(x) n &lt;- nchar(x, &#39;width&#39;) i &lt;- seq_along(x) # line numbers n &lt;- n + nchar(i) s &lt;- strrep(&#39; &#39;, max(n) - n) x &lt;- paste(x, s, &#39; # &#39;, i, sep = &#39;&#39;, collapse = &#39;\\n&#39;) hook_source(x, options) }) }) ``` Now we can test the new hook. When you knit this document, you will see line numbers in trailing comments. ```{r} if (TRUE) { x &lt;- 1:10 x + 1 } ``` The main trick in the above example is to determine the number of spaces needed before the comment on each line, so the comments can align to the right. The number depends on the widths of each line of code. We leave it to readers to digest the code in the hook function. Note that the function strrep() is used to generate spaces of specified lengths, e.g., strrep(&quot; &quot;, c(1, 3, 6, 0)) ## [1] &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;&quot; The method introduced in Section 5.7 may be the actual way in which you want to add line numbers to source code. The syntax is cleaner, and it works for both source code and text output blocks. The above source hook trick mainly aims to show you one possibility of manipulating the source code with a custom function. "],["hook-scroll.html", "12.3 Scrollable text output", " 12.3 Scrollable text output In Section 7.4, we showed how to restrict the heights of code blocks and text output blocks via CSS. In fact, there is a simpler method with the chunk options attr.source and attr.output to add the style attribute to the fenced code blocks in the Markdown output (see Section 11.13 for more information on these options). For example, for this code chunk with the attr.output option: ```{r, attr.output=&#39;style=&quot;max-height: 100px;&quot;&#39;} 1:300 ``` Its Markdown output will be: ```r 1:300 ``` ```{style=&quot;max-height: 100px;&quot;} ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## [11] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ## ... ... ``` Then the text output block will be converted to HTML by Pandoc: &lt;pre style=&quot;max-height: 100px;&quot;&gt; &lt;code&gt;## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ## [11] 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 ## ... ...&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; To learn more about Pandoc’s fenced code blocks, please read its manual at https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#fenced-code-blocks. The attr.source and attr.output options have made it possible for us to specify maximum heights for individual code chunks. However, the syntax is a little clunky, and requires a better understanding of CSS and Pandoc’s Markdown syntax. Below we show an example of a custom output hook that works with a custom chunk option max.height, so you will only need to set the chunk option like max.height = \"100px\" instead of attr.output = 'style=\"max-height: 100px;\"'. In this example, we only manipulate the options argument, but not the x argument. --- title: Scrollable code blocks output: html_document: highlight: tango --- We set up an `output` hook to add a `style` attribute to the text output when the chunk option `max.height` is set. ```{r, include=FALSE} options(width = 60) local({ hook_output &lt;- knitr::knit_hooks$get(&#39;output&#39;) knitr::knit_hooks$set(output = function(x, options) { if (!is.null(options$max.height)) options$attr.output &lt;- c( options$attr.output, sprintf(&#39;style=&quot;max-height: %s;&quot;&#39;, options$max.height) ) hook_output(x, options) }) }) ``` Without the `max.height` option, you will see the full output, e.g., ```{r} 1:100 ``` Now we set `max.height` to `100px`. You will see a scrollbar in the text output because its height is larger than 100px. ```{r, max.height=&#39;100px&#39;} 1:100 ``` Essentially the `max.height` option is converted to the `attr.output` option. It works even if the `attr.output` option is present, i.e., it will not override the `attr.output` option, e.g., we show line numbers on the left side of the text output via the `.numberLines` attribute: ```{r, max.height=&#39;100px&#39;, attr.output=&#39;.numberLines&#39;} 1:100 ``` Figure 12.1 shows the output. Note that in the last code chunk with the chunk option attr.output, the option will not be overridden by max.height because we respect existing attributes by combining them with the style attribute generated by max.height: options$attr.output &lt;- c( options$attr.output, sprintf(&#39;style=&quot;max-height: %s;&quot;&#39;, options$max.height) ) FIGURE 12.1: An example of scrollable text output, with its height specified in the chunk option max.height.

"],["hook-truncate.html", "12.4 Truncate text output", " 12.4 Truncate text output When the text output from a code chunk is lengthy, you may want to only show the first few lines. For example, when printing a data frame of a few thousand rows, it may not be helpful to show the full data, and the first few lines may be enough. Below we redefine the output hook so that we can control the maximum number of lines via a custom chunk option out.lines: # save the built-in output hook hook_output &lt;- knitr::knit_hooks$get(&quot;output&quot;) # set a new output hook to truncate text output knitr::knit_hooks$set(output = function(x, options) { if (!is.null(n &lt;- options$out.lines)) { x &lt;- xfun::split_lines(x) if (length(x) &gt; n) { # truncate the output x &lt;- c(head(x, n), &quot;....\\n&quot;) } x &lt;- paste(x, collapse = &quot;\\n&quot;) } hook_output(x, options) }) The basic idea of the above hook function is that if the number of lines of the text output is greater than the threshold set in the chunk option out.lines (stored in the variable n in the function body), we only keep the first n lines and add an ellipsis (....) to indicate the output is truncated. Now we can test the new output hook by setting the chunk option out.lines = 4 on the chunk below: print(cars) ## speed dist ## 1 4 2 ## 2 4 10 ## 3 7 4 .... And you see four lines of output as expected. Since we have stored the original output hook in hook_output, we can restore it by calling the set() method again: knitr::knit_hooks$set(output = hook_output) As an exercise for readers, you may try to truncate the output in a different way: given the chunk option out.lines to determine the maximum number of lines, can you truncate the output in the middle instead of the end?

Note that we actually overrode the default plot hook in this example, while most other examples in this chapter build custom hooks on top of the default hooks. You should completely override default hooks only when you are sure you want to ignore some built-in features of the default hooks. For example, the plot hook function in this case did not consider possible chunk options like out.width = '100%' or fig.show = 'animate'. FIGURE 12.2: A figure in the HTML5 figure tag. This example shows you what you can possibly do with the plot file path x in the plot hook. If all you need is to customize the style of figures, you do not have to use the HTML5 tags.

"],["chunk-hooks.html", "Chapter 13 Chunk Hooks (*)", " Chapter 13 Chunk Hooks (*) A chunk hook is a function that is triggered by a chunk option when the value of this chunk option is not NULL. Chunk hooks provide a way for you to execute additional tasks beyond running the code in a chunk. For example, you may want to post-process plots (e.g., Section 13.1 and Section 13.2), or record the time taken by a code chunk (Section 13.3). Such tasks may not be essential to the computing or analysis in the report, but they can be useful for other purposes (e.g., enhance plots or help you identify the most time-consuming chunks). You can use chunk hooks purely for their side effects (e.g., only printing out certain information to the console), or for their returned values, which will be written to the output document if the value is a character value. Like output hooks (see Chapter 12), chunk hooks are also registered via the object knitr::knit_hooks. Please note that the names of output hooks are reserved by knitr, so you must not use these names for your custom chunk hooks: names(knitr:::.default.hooks) ## [1] &quot;source&quot; &quot;output&quot; ## [3] &quot;warning&quot; &quot;message&quot; ## [5] &quot;error&quot; &quot;plot&quot; ## [7] &quot;inline&quot; &quot;chunk&quot; ## [9] &quot;text&quot; &quot;evaluate.inline&quot; ## [11] &quot;evaluate&quot; &quot;document&quot; A chunk hook is associated with a chunk option of the same name. For example, you can register a chunk hook with the name greet: knitr::knit_hooks$set(greet = function(before) { if (before) &quot;Hello!&quot; else &quot;Bye!&quot; }) We will explain the arguments of the hook function in a moment. Now we set the chunk option greet = TRUE for the chunk below: ```{r, greet=TRUE} 1 + 1 ``` And you will see that “Hello!” appears before the chunk, and “Bye!” appears after the chunk in the output below (which is because they are character values): Hello! 1 + 1 ## [1] 2 Bye! A chunk hook function can possibly take four arguments: before, options, envir, and name. In other words, it can be of this form: function(before, options, envir, name) { } All four arguments are optional. You can have four, three, two, one, or even no arguments. In the above example, we used one argument (i.e., before). The meanings of these arguments are: before: Whether the chunk hook is currently being executed before or after the code chunk itself is executed. Note that a chunk hook is executed twice for every code chunk (once before with hook(before = TRUE) and once after with hook(before = FALSE). options: The list of chunk options for the current code chunk, e.g., list(fig.width = 5, echo = FALSE, ...). envir: The environment in which the chunk hook is evaluated. name: The name of the chunk option that triggered the chunk hook. As we mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, non-character values returned by chunk hooks are silently ignored, and character values are written to the output document. "],["crop-plot.html", "13.1 Crop plots", " 13.1 Crop plots The chunk hook knitr::hook_pdfcrop() can be used to crop PDF and other types of plot files, i.e., remove the extra margins in plots. To enable it, set this hook via knit_hooks$set() in a code chunk, and turn on the corresponding chunk option, e.g., knitr::knit_hooks$set(crop = knitr::hook_pdfcrop) Then you can use the chunk option crop = TRUE to crop plots in a code chunk. The hook hook_pdfcrop() calls the external program pdfcrop to crop PDF files. This program often comes with a LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live or MiKTeX). You can check if it is available in your system via: # if the returned value is not empty, it is available Sys.which(&quot;pdfcrop&quot;) ## pdfcrop ## &quot;/home/runner/.TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-linux/pdfcrop&quot; If you are using the LaTeX distribution TinyTeX (see Section 1.2), and pdfcrop is not available in your system, you may install it via tinytex::tlmgr_install('pdfcrop'). For non-PDF plot files such as PNG or JPEG files, this hook function calls the R package magick (Ooms 2025) for cropping. You need to make sure this R package has been installed. Figure 13.1 shows a plot that is not cropped, and Figure 13.2 shows the same plot but has been cropped. FIGURE 13.1: A plot that is not cropped. FIGURE 13.2: A plot that is cropped.

"],["time-chunk.html", "13.3 Report how much time each chunk takes to run", " 13.3 Report how much time each chunk takes to run By default, knitr provides a text-based progress bar to show you the knitting progress. If you want more precise timing information about the chunks, you may register a custom chunk hook to record the time for each chunk. Here is an example hook: knitr::knit_hooks$set(time_it = local({ now &lt;- NULL function(before, options) { if (before) { # record the current time before each chunk now &lt;&lt;- Sys.time() } else { # calculate the time difference after a chunk res &lt;- difftime(Sys.time(), now, units = &quot;secs&quot;) # return a character string to show the time paste(&quot;Time for this code chunk to run:&quot;, round(res, 2), &quot;seconds&quot;) } } })) Then you can time a chunk with the chunk option time_it, e.g., ```{r, time_it = TRUE} Sys.sleep(2) ``` If you want to time all code chunks, you can certainly set the option globally: knitr::opts_chunk$set(time_it = TRUE). In the above hook function, you can also output more information from the chunk options (i.e., the options argument of the function). For example, you may print out the chunk label in the returned value: paste(&quot;Time for the chunk&quot;, options$label, &quot;to run:&quot;, res) Or you may record the time without printing it out in the hook: all_times &lt;- list() # store the time for each chunk knitr::knit_hooks$set(time_it = local({ now &lt;- NULL function(before, options) { if (before) { now &lt;&lt;- Sys.time() } else { res &lt;- difftime(Sys.time(), now) all_times[[options$label]] &lt;&lt;- res } } })) Then you can access all the time information in the object all_times. This object is a named list with the names being chunk labels, and element values being the execution time for each chunk. Lastly, as a technical note, we want to explain the use of the local() function in the previous hooks because some readers may not be familiar with it. This function allows you to run code in a “local” environment. The main benefit is that variables created in the code are local to that environment, so they will not pollute the outer environment (usually the global environment). For example, we created a variable now in local(), and used it in the time_it hook function. In the hook function, we update the value of now via the double arrow &lt;&lt;- instead of the normal assignment operator &lt;-. This is because &lt;&lt;- assigns a value to a variable in the parent environment (which is the environment in local() in this case), and &lt;- can only assign values to variables in the current environment. Before each code chunk is evaluated, the local variable now records the current time. After each code chunk is evaluated, we calculate the time difference between the current time and now. Note that local() returns the last value in the expression passed to it, which is a (hook) function in this case. In short, local() can make your workspace cleaner by not exposing variables that are only used locally but unused in the global environment. If you do not mind creating a variable now in the global environment, you can choose not to use local(). "],["show-header.html", "13.4 Show the chunk header in the output", " 13.4 Show the chunk header in the output Sometimes you may want to show the original code chunk header to your readers. For example, when you write an R Markdown tutorial, you may want to show both the chunk output and the chunk options that you used to generate the output, so your readers can learn how to do it by themselves. The original chunk options are actually stored as a character string in the chunk option params.src. After you know this, you may write a chunk hook to add params.src to the output. Below is a full example: --- title: Show chunk headers in the output --- Set up a chunk hook named `wrapper` to wrap the chunk output inside the original chunk header and footer. ```{r, setup, include=FALSE} knitr::knit_hooks$set(wrapper = function(before, options) { # the original chunk might be indented if (is.null(indent &lt;- options$indent)) indent &lt;- &#39;&#39; # hide the wrapper=TRUE option opts &lt;- gsub(&#39;, wrapper=TRUE&#39;, &#39;&#39;, options$params.src) if (before) { # add the header sprintf(&#39;\\n\\n%s````\\n```{r,%s}\\n````\\n&#39;, indent, opts) } else { # add the footer sprintf(&#39;\\n\\n%s````\\n```\\n````\\n&#39;, indent) } }) ``` Now we apply the hook via the chunk option `wrapper=TRUE`. Remember to put `wrapper=TRUE` at the end of the header, and it has to be `wrapper=TRUE` precisely (e.g., not `wrapper=T`), following a comma and a space, unless you adjust the `gsub()` call in the above hook. ```{r, test-label, collapse=TRUE, wrapper=TRUE} 1 + 1 plot(cars) ``` You should see the original chunk header appear in the output. The hook should also work when the chunk is indented, e.g., - One bullet. ```{r, eval=TRUE, wrapper=TRUE} 2 + 2 ``` - Another bullet. Basically, we restored the chunk header from options$params.src by putting this string inside ```{r, }. Then we wrapped this line in a pair of four backticks, so it can be displayed verbatim in the output. Note that the original code chunk might be indented (e.g., when it is nested in a list item), so we also need to add the proper indentation, which is stored in the chunk option options$indent. The output of the bullet list at the end of the above example will be like this: One bullet. ```{r, eval=TRUE} 2 + 2 ## [1] 4 ``` Another bullet. You can see that the code chunk was evaluated, and the chunk header was also added.

We introduce these tricks in this chapter, such as how to reuse code chunks, exit knitting early, display a plot in a custom place, and so on. "],["reuse-chunks.html", "14.1 Reuse code chunks", " 14.1 Reuse code chunks You can freely reuse code chunks anywhere in your source document without cut-and-paste. The key is to label your code chunks, so you can refer to them with labels in other places. There are three ways to reuse code chunks. 14.1.1 Embed one chunk in another chunk (*) You can embed one code chunk in another code chunk by enclosing its label in &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;. Then knitr will automatically expand the string &lt;&lt;label&gt;&gt; to the actual code. For example, you can create an R function in this way: We define a function to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. ```{r, f2c} F2C &lt;- function(x) { &lt;&lt;check-arg&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;convert&gt;&gt; } ``` First, we check if the input value is numeric: ```{r, check-arg, eval=FALSE} if (!is.numeric(x)) stop(&quot;The input must be numeric!&quot;) ``` Then we do the actual conversion: ```{r, convert, eval=FALSE} (x - 32) * 5/ 9 ``` This is based on one of the main ideas of Literate Programming, which was proposed by Donald Knuth. The advantage of this technique is that you can split (complex) code into smaller parts, write each part in a separate code chunk, and explain them with narratives. All parts can be composed into the main code chunk to be executed. For the above example, the first code chunk (with the label f2c) will become: ```{r, f2c} F2C &lt;- function(x) { if (!is.numeric(x)) stop(&quot;The input must be numeric!&quot;) (x - 32) * 5/ 9 } ``` You can embed an arbitrary number of other code chunks in one code chunk. The embedding can also be recursive. For example, you may embed chunk A in chunk B, and chunk B in chunk C. Then chunk C will include code from chunk A via chunk B. The marker &lt;&lt;label&gt;&gt; has to be on a separate line. Only white spaces are allowed before and after the marker. 14.1.2 Use the same chunk label in another chunk If you want to use exactly the same code chunk two or more times, you may define the chunk with a label, and create more code chunks with the same label but leave the chunk content empty, e.g., Here is a code chunk that is not evaluated: ```{r, chunk-one, eval=FALSE} 1 + 1 2 + 2 ``` Now we actually evaluate it: ```{r, chunk-one, eval=TRUE} ``` We used the chunk label “chunk-one” twice in the above example, and the second chunk just reuses code from the first chunk. We recommend that you do not use this method to run a code chunk more than once to generate plots (or other files), because plot files created from a later chunk may overwrite files from a previous chunk. It is okay if only one of such chunks uses the chunk option eval = TRUE, and all other chunks use eval = FALSE. 14.1.3 Use reference labels (*) The chunk option ref.label takes a vector of chunk labels to retrieve the content of these chunks. For example, the code chunk with the label chunk-a is the combination of chunk-c and chunk-b below: ```{r chunk-a, ref.label=c(&#39;chunk-c&#39;, &#39;chunk-b&#39;)} ``` ```{r chunk-b} # this is the chunk b 1 + 1 ``` ```{r chunk-c} # this is the chunk c 2 + 2 ``` In other words, chunk-a is essentially this: ```{r chunk-a} # this is the chunk c 2 + 2 # this is the chunk b 1 + 1 ``` The chunk option ref.label has provided a very flexible way of reorganizing code chunks in a document without resorting to cut-and-paste. It does not matter if the code chunks referenced are before or after the code chunk that uses ref.label. An early code chunk can reference a later chunk. There is an application of this chunk option in Section 4.19. "],["load-cache.html", "14.2 Use an object before it is created (*)", " 14.2 Use an object before it is created (*) All code in a knitr document, including the code in code chunks and inline R expressions, is executed in linear order from beginning to end. In theory, you cannot use a variable before it is assigned a value. However, in certain cases, we may want to mention the value of a variable earlier in the document. For example, it is common to present a result in the abstract of an article, but the result is actually computed later in the document. Below is an example that illustrates the idea but will not compile: --- title: An important report abstract: &gt; In this analysis, the average value of `x` is `r mx`. --- We create the object `mx` in the following chunk: ```{r} x &lt;- 1:100 mx &lt;- mean(x) ``` To solve this problem, the value of the object has to be saved somewhere and loaded the next time when the document is compiled. Please note that this means the document has to be compiled at least twice. Below is one possible solution using the saveRDS() function: ```{r, include=FALSE} mx &lt;- if (file.exists(&#39;mean.rds&#39;)) { readRDS(&#39;mean.rds&#39;) } else { &quot;The value of `mx` is not available yet&quot; } ``` --- title: An important report abstract: &gt; In this analysis, the average value of `x` is `r mx`. --- We create the object `mx` in the following chunk: ```{r} x &lt;- 1:100 mx &lt;- mean(x) saveRDS(mx, &#39;mean.rds&#39;) ``` The first time you compile this document, you will see the phrase “The value of mx is not available yet” in the abstract. Later, when you compile it again, you will see the actual value of mx. The function knitr::load_cache() is an alternative solution, which allows you to load the value of an object from a specific code chunk after the chunk has been cached. The idea is similar to the above example, but it will save you the effort of manually saving and loading an object, because the object is automatically saved to the cache database, and you only need to load it via load_cache(). Below is the simplified example: --- title: An important report abstract: &gt; In this analysis, the average value of `x` is `r knitr::load_cache(&#39;mean-x&#39;, &#39;mx&#39;)`. --- We create the object `mx` in the following chunk: ```{r mean-x, cache=TRUE} x &lt;- 1:100 mx &lt;- mean(x) ``` In this example, we added a chunk label mean-x to the R code chunk (which is passed to the load_cache() function), and cached it using the chunk option cache = TRUE. All objects in this code chunk will be saved to the cache database. Again, you will have to compile this document at least twice, so the object mx can be correctly loaded from the cache database. If the value of mx is not going to be changed in the future, you do not need to compile the document one more time. If you do not specify the object name in the second argument to load_cache(), the whole cache database will be loaded into the current environment. You can then use any objects that were in the cache database before these objects are created later in the document, e.g., knitr::load_cache(&quot;mean-x&quot;) x # the object `x` mx # the object `mx` "],["knit-exit.html", "14.3 Exit knitting early", " 14.3 Exit knitting early Sometimes we may want to exit knitting early and not at the end of the document. For example, we may be working on some analysis and only wish to share the first half of the results, or we may still be working on code at the bottom that is not yet complete. In these situations, we could consider using the knit_exit() function in a code chunk, which will end the knitting process after that chunk. Below is a simple example, where we have a very simple chunk followed by a more time-consuming one: ```{r} 1 + 1 knitr::knit_exit() ``` You will only see the above content in the output. ```{r} Sys.sleep(100) ``` Normally you have to wait for 100 seconds, but since we have called knit_exit(), the rest of the document will be ignored.

Then in another paragraph, we called the function knitr::fig_chunk() to retrieve the path of the plot file, which is usually like test_files/figure-html/cars-plot-1.png.

This is usually problematic for base R graphics (not so for grid graphics such as those created from ggplot2 (Wickham, Chang, et al. 2025) because plots can be saved to R objects). For example, if we draw a plot in one code chunk, and add a line to the plot in a later chunk, R will signal an error saying that a high-level plot has not been created, so it could not add the line. If you want the graphical device to remain open for all code chunks, you may set a knitr package option in the beginning of your document device: knitr::opts_knit$set(global.device = TRUE) Please note that it is opts_knit instead of the more frequently used opts_chunk.

You may have seen an error message like this: processing file: myfile.Rmd Error in parse_block(g[-1], g[1], params.src, markdown_mode) : Duplicate chunk label &#39;cars&#39; Calls: &lt;Anonymous&gt; ... process_file -&gt; split_file -&gt; lapply -&gt; FUN -&gt; parse_block Execution halted However, there are scenarios where we may wish to allow duplicate labels. For example, if we have one parent document parent.Rmd in which we knit the child document multiple times, it will fail: # settings settings &lt;- list(...) # run once knit_child(&quot;useful_analysis.Rmd&quot;) # new settings settings &lt;- list(...) # run again knit_child(&quot;useful_analysis.Rmd&quot;) In this scenario, we can allow duplicate labels by setting this global option in R before the child document is knitted: options(knitr.duplicate.label = &quot;allow&quot;) If you want to allow duplicate labels in the main document instead of the child document, you have to set this option before knitr::knit() is called. One possible way to achieve that is to set the option in your ~/.Rprofile file (see the help page ?Rprofile for more information). You should set this option with caution. As with most error messages, they are there for a reason. Allowing duplicate chunks can create silent problems with figures and cross references. For example, in theory, if two code chunks have the same label and both chunks generate plots, their plot files will overwrite each other (without error or warning messages), because the filenames of plots are determined by the chunk labels. With the option knitr.duplicate.label = \"allow\", knitr will silently change the duplicate labels by adding numeric suffixes. For example, for the two code chunks: ```{r, test} plot(1:10) ``` ```{r, test} plot(10:1) ``` The second label will be silently changed to test-1. This may avoid overwriting the plot from the chunk with the label test, but it also makes the chunk label unpredictable, so you may have difficulties in cross-referencing figures (see Section 4.7), because the cross references are also based on chunk labels. "],["cache-rds.html", "14.9 A more transparent caching mechanism", " 14.9 A more transparent caching mechanism Note: A new caching mechanism xfun::cache_exec() has been introduced to supersede the xfun::cache_rds() introduced in this section. You are now recommended to use xfun::cache_exec(), which is also transparent and yet still flexible. If you feel the caching mechanism of knitr introduced in Section 11.4 is too complicated (it is!), you may consider a simpler caching mechanism based on the function xfun::cache_rds(), e.g., xfun::cache_rds({ # write your time-consuming code in this expression }) The tricky thing about knitr’s caching is how it decides when to invalidate the cache. For xfun::cache_rds(), it is much clearer: the first time you pass an R expression to this function, it evaluates the expression and saves the result to a .rds file; the next time you run cache_rds() again, it reads the .rds file and returns the result immediately without evaluating the expression again. The most obvious way to invalidate the cache is to delete the .rds file. If you do not want to manually delete it, you may call xfun::cache_rds() with the argument rerun = TRUE. When xfun::cache_rds() is called inside a code chunk in a knitr source document, the path of the .rds file is determined by the chunk option cache.path and the chunk label. For example, for a code chunk with the chunk label foo in the Rmd document input.Rmd: ```{r, foo} res &lt;- xfun::cache_rds({ Sys.sleep(3) 1:10 }) ``` The path of the .rds file will be of the form input_cache/FORMAT/foo_HASH.rds, where FORMAT is the Pandoc output format name (e.g., html or latex), and HASH is an MD5 hash that contains 32 hexadecimal digits (consisting a-z and 0-9), e.g., input_cache/html/foo_7a3f22c4309d400eff95de0e8bddac71.rds. As documented on the help page ?xfun::cache_rds, there are two common cases in which you may want to invalidate the cache: 1) the code in the expression to be evaluated has changed; 2) the code uses an external variable, and the value of that variable has changed. Next we will explain how these two ways of cache invalidation work, as well as how to keep multiple copies of the cache corresponding to different versions of the code. 14.9.1 Invalidate the cache by changing code in the expression When you change the code in cache_rds() (e.g., from cache_rds({x + 1}) to cache_rds({x + 2})), the cache will be automatically invalidated and the expression will be re-evaluated. However, please note that changes in white spaces or comments do not matter. Or generally speaking, as long as the change does not affect the parsed expression, the cache will not be invalidated. For example, the two expressions passed to cache_rds() below are essentially identical: res &lt;- xfun::cache_rds({ Sys.sleep(3 ); x&lt;-1:10; # semi-colons won&#39;t matter x+1; }) res &lt;- xfun::cache_rds({ Sys.sleep(3) x &lt;- 1:10 # a comment x + 1 # feel free to make any changes in white spaces }) Hence if you have executed cache_rds() on the first expression, the second expression will be able to take advantage of the cache. This feature is helpful because it allows you make cosmetic changes in your code without invalidating the cache. If you are not sure if two versions of code are equivalent, you may try the parse_code() below: parse_code &lt;- function(expr) { deparse(substitute(expr)) } # white spaces and semi-colons do not matter parse_code({x+1}) ## [1] &quot;{&quot; &quot; x + 1&quot; &quot;}&quot; parse_code({ x + 1; }) ## [1] &quot;{&quot; &quot; x + 1&quot; &quot;}&quot; # left arrow and right arrow are equivalent identical(parse_code({x &lt;- 1}), parse_code({1 -&gt; x})) ## [1] TRUE 14.9.2 Invalidate the cache by changes in global variables There are two types of variables in an expression: global variables and local variables. Global variables are those created outside the expression, and local variables are those created inside the expression. If the value of a global variable in the expression has changed, your cached result will no longer reflect the result that you would obtain by running the expression again. For example, in the expression below, if y has changed, you are most likely to want to invalidate the cache and rerun the expression, otherwise you still get the result from the old value of y: y &lt;- 2 res &lt;- xfun::cache_rds({ x &lt;- 1:10 x + y }) To invalidate the cache when y has changed, you may let cache_rds() know through the hash argument that y needs to be considered when deciding if the cache should be invalidated: res &lt;- xfun::cache_rds({ x &lt;- 1:10 x + y }, hash = list(y)) When the value of the hash argument is changed, the 32-digit hash in the cache filename (as mentioned earlier) will change accordingly, therefore the cache will be invalidated. This provides a way to specify the cache’s dependency on other R objects. For example, if you want the cache to be dependent on the version of R, you may specify the dependency like this: res &lt;- xfun::cache_rds({ x &lt;- 1:10 x + y }, hash = list(y, getRversion())) Or if you want the cache to depend on when a data file was last modified: res &lt;- xfun::cache_rds({ x &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data.csv&quot;) x[[1]] + y }, hash = list(y, file.mtime(&quot;data.csv&quot;))) If you do not want to provide this list of global variables to the hash argument, you may try hash = \"auto\" instead, which tells cache_rds() to try to figure out all global variables automatically and use a list of their values as the value for the hash argument, e.g., res &lt;- xfun::cache_rds({ x &lt;- 1:10 x + y + z # y and z are global variables }, hash = &quot;auto&quot;) This is equivalent to: res &lt;- xfun::cache_rds({ x &lt;- 1:10 x + y + z # y and z are global variables }, hash = list(y = y, z = z)) The global variables are identified by codetools::findGlobals() when hash = \"auto\", which may not be completely reliable. You know your own code the best, so we recommend that you specify the list of values explicitly in the hash argument if you want to be completely sure which variables can invalidate the cache. 14.9.3 Keep multiple copies of the cache Since the cache is typically used for time-consuming code, perhaps you should invalidate it conservatively. You might regret invalidating the cache too soon or aggressively, because if you should need an older version of the cache again, you would have to wait for a long time for the computing to be redone. The clean argument of cache_rds() allows you to keep older copies of the cache if you set it to FALSE. You can also set the global R option options(xfun.cache_rds.clean = FALSE) if you want this to be the default behavior throughout the entire R session. By default, clean = TRUE and cache_rds() will try to delete the older cache every time. Setting clean = FALSE can be useful if you are still experimenting with the code. For example, you can cache two versions of a linear model: model &lt;- xfun::cache_rds({ lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars) }, clean = FALSE) model &lt;- xfun::cache_rds({ lm(dist ~ speed + I(speed^2), data = cars) }, clean = FALSE) After you decide which model to use, you can set clean = TRUE again, or delete this argument (so the default TRUE is used). 14.9.4 Comparison with knitr’s caching You may wonder when to use knitr’s caching (i.e., set the chunk option cache = TRUE), and when to use xfun::cache_rds() in a knitr source document. The biggest disadvantage of xfun::cache_rds() is that it does not cache side effects (but only the value of the expression), whereas knitr does. Some side effects may be useful, such as printed output or plots. For example, in the code below, the text output and the plot will be lost when cache_rds() loads the cache the next time, and only the value 1:10 will be returned: xfun::cache_rds({ print(&quot;Hello world!&quot;) plot(cars) 1:10 }) By comparison, for a code chunk with the option cache = TRUE, everything will be cached: ```{r, cache=TRUE} print(&quot;Hello world!&quot;) plot(cars) 1:10 ``` The biggest disadvantage of knitr’s caching (and also what users complain most frequently about) is that your cache might be inadvertently invalidated, because the cache is determined by too many factors. For example, any changes in chunk options can invalidate the cache,17 but some chunk options may not be relevant to the computing. In the code chunk below, changing the chunk option fig.width = 6 to fig.width = 10 should not invalidate the cache, but it will: ```{r, cache=TRUE, fig.width=6} # there are no plots in this chunk x &lt;- rnorm(1000) mean(x) ``` Actually, knitr caching is quite powerful and flexible, and its behavior can be tweaked in many ways. As its author, I often doubt if it is worth introducing these lesser-known features, because you may end up spending much more time on learning and understanding how the cache works than the time the actual computing takes. In case it is not clear, xfun::cache_rds() is a general way for caching the computing, and it works anywhere, whereas knitr’s caching only works in knitr documents. This is the default behavior, and you can change it. See https://yihui.org/knitr/demo/cache/ for how you can make the cache more granular, so not all chunk options affect the cache.↩︎ "],["other-languages.html", "Chapter 15 Other Languages", " Chapter 15 Other Languages Besides the R language, many other languages are supported in R Markdown through the knitr package. The language name is indicated by the first word in the curly braces after the three opening backticks. For example, the little r in ```{r} indicates that the code chunk contains R code, and ```{python} is a Python code chunk. In this chapter, we show a few languages that you may not be familiar with. In knitr, each language is supported through a language engine. Language engines are essentially functions that take the source code and options of a chunk as the input, and return a character string as the output. They are managed through the object knitr::knit_engines. You may check the existing engines via: names(knitr::knit_engines$get()) ## [1] &quot;awk&quot; &quot;bash&quot; &quot;coffee&quot; &quot;gawk&quot; ## [5] &quot;groovy&quot; &quot;haskell&quot; &quot;lein&quot; &quot;mysql&quot; ## [9] &quot;node&quot; &quot;octave&quot; &quot;perl&quot; &quot;php&quot; ## [13] &quot;psql&quot; &quot;Rscript&quot; &quot;ruby&quot; &quot;sas&quot; ## [17] &quot;scala&quot; &quot;sed&quot; &quot;sh&quot; &quot;stata&quot; ## [21] &quot;zsh&quot; &quot;asis&quot; &quot;asy&quot; &quot;block&quot; ## [25] &quot;block2&quot; &quot;bslib&quot; &quot;c&quot; &quot;cat&quot; ## [29] &quot;cc&quot; &quot;comment&quot; &quot;css&quot; &quot;ditaa&quot; ## [33] &quot;dot&quot; &quot;embed&quot; &quot;eviews&quot; &quot;exec&quot; ## [37] &quot;fortran&quot; &quot;fortran95&quot; &quot;go&quot; &quot;highlight&quot; ## [41] &quot;js&quot; &quot;julia&quot; &quot;python&quot; &quot;R&quot; ## [45] &quot;Rcpp&quot; &quot;sass&quot; &quot;scss&quot; &quot;sql&quot; ## [49] &quot;stan&quot; &quot;targets&quot; &quot;tikz&quot; &quot;verbatim&quot; At the moment, most code chunks of non-R languages are executed independently. For example, all bash code chunks in the same document are executed separately in their own sessions, so a later bash code chunk cannot use variables created in a previous bash chunk, and the changed working directory (via cd) will not be persistent across different bash chunks. Only R, Python, and Julia code chunks are executed in the same session. Please note that all R code chunks are executed in the same R session, and all Python code chunks are executed in the same Python session, etc. The R session and the Python session are two different sessions, but it is possible to access or manipulate objects of one session from another session (see Section 15.2). Section 2.7 of the R Markdown Definitive Guide (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018) shows examples of using Python, Shell, SQL, Rcpp, Stan, JavaScript, CSS, Julia, C, and Fortran code in R Markdown. In this chapter, we will show more language engines, and you may find more examples in the repository at https://github.com/yihui/knitr-examples (look for filenames that contain the word “engine”). First, let’s reveal how a language engine works by registering a custom language engine. References "],["custom-engine.html", "15.1 Register a custom language engine (*)", " 15.1 Register a custom language engine (*) You can register a custom language engine via the method knitr::knit_engines$set(). It accepts a function as its input, e.g., knitr::knit_engines$set(foo = function(options) { # the source code is in options$code; just do # whatever you want with it }) This registers the foo engine, and you will be able to use a code chunk that starts with ```{foo}. The engine function has one argument, options, which is a list of chunk options of the code chunk. You can access the source code of the chunk as a character vector in options$code. For example, for the code chunk: ```{foo} 1 + 1 2 + 2 ``` The code element of options would be a character vector c('1 + 1', '2 + 2'). Language engines do not really have to deal with computer languages, but can process any text in a code chunk. First, we show a simple example of an engine that converts the content of a code chunk to uppercase: knitr::knit_engines$set(upper = function(options) { code &lt;- paste(options$code, collapse = &quot;\\n&quot;) if (options$eval) toupper(code) else code }) The key is that we apply the function toupper to the “code,” and return the result as a single character string (by concatenating all lines of code by \\n). Note that toupper() is applied only when the chunk option eval = TRUE, otherwise the original string is returned. This shows you how to make use of chunk options like eval inside the engine function. Similarly, you may consider adding if (options$results == 'hide') return() to the function body to hide the output when the chunk option results = 'hide'. Below is an example chunk that uses the upper engine, with its output: ```{upper} Hello, **knitr** engines! ``` HELLO, KNITR ENGINES! Next we show an example of an alternative Python engine18 named py. This engine is implemented by simply calling the python command via the R function system2(): knitr::knit_engines$set(py = function(options) { code &lt;- paste(options$code, collapse = &#39;\\n&#39;) out &lt;- system2( &#39;python&#39;, c(&#39;-c&#39;, shQuote(code)), stdout = TRUE ) knitr::engine_output(options, code, out) }) To fully understand the above engine function, you need to know the following: Given Python code as a character string (code in the above function), we can execute the code via a command-line call python -c 'code'. That is what system2() does. We collect the (text) output by specifying stdout = TRUE in system2(). You can pass the chunk options, source code, and text output to the function knitr::engine_output() to generate the final output. This function deals with common chunk options like echo = FALSE and results = 'hide', so you do not need to take care of these cases. A lot of language engines in knitr are defined in this way (i.e., using system2() to execute commands corresponding to languages). If you are curious about the technical details, you may check out the source code of most language engines in the R source code here: https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/R/engine.R. Now we can use the new engine py, e.g., ```{py} print(1 + 1) ``` ## 2 You can even override existing language engines in knitr via knitr::knit_engines$set(), if you are sure that your versions are necessary or better than the existing ones. Usually we do not recommend that you do this because it may surprise users who are familiar with existing engines, but we want to make you aware of this possibility anyway. In practice, you should use the built-in python engine instead, which is based on the reticulate package and supports Python code chunks much better (see Section 15.2).↩︎ "],["eng-python.html", "15.2 Run Python code and interact with Python", " 15.2 Run Python code and interact with Python We know you love Python, so let’s make it super clear: R Markdown and knitr do support Python. To add a Python code chunk to an R Markdown document, you can use the chunk header ```{python}, e.g., ```{python} print(&quot;Hello Python!&quot;) ``` You can add chunk options to the chunk header as usual, such as echo = FALSE or eval = FALSE. Plots drawn with the matplotlib package in Python are also supported. The Python support in R Markdown and knitr is based on the reticulate package (Ushey, Allaire, and Tang 2025), and one important feature of this package is that it allows two-way communication between Python and R. For example, you may access or create Python variables from the R session via the object py in reticulate: ```{r, setup} library(reticulate) ``` Create a variable `x` in the Python session: ```{python} x = [1, 2, 3] ``` Access the Python variable `x` in an R code chunk: ```{r} py$x ``` Create a new variable `y` in the Python session using R, and pass a data frame to `y`: ```{r} py$y &lt;- head(cars) ``` Print the variable `y` in Python: ```{python} print(y) ``` For more information about the reticulate package, you may see its documentation at https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/. References "],["eng-asis.html", "15.3 Execute content conditionally via the asis engine", " 15.3 Execute content conditionally via the asis engine As its name indicates, the asis engine writes out the chunk content as is. The advantage of using this engine is that you can include some content conditionally—the display of the chunk content is decided by the chunk option echo. When echo = FALSE, the chunk will be hidden. Below is a simple example: ```{r} getRandomNumber &lt;- function() { sample(1:6, 1) } ``` ```{asis, echo = getRandomNumber() == 4} According to https://xkcd.com/221/, we just generated a **true** random number! ``` The text in the asis chunk will be displayed only if the condition getRandomNumber() == 4 is (randomly) true.

It will ignore profile files like ~/.bash_profile and ~/.bash_login, in which you may have defined command aliases or modified environment variables like the PATH variable. If you want these profile files to be executed just like when you use the terminal, you may pass the argument -l to bash via engine.opts, e.g., ```{bash, engine.opts=&#39;-l&#39;} echo $PATH ``` If you want to enable the -l argument globally for all bash chunks, you may set it in the global chunk option in the beginning of your document: knitr::opts_chunk$set(engine.opts = list(bash = &quot;-l&quot;)) You can also pass other arguments to bash by providing them as a character vector to the chunk option engine.opts.

Of course, you may do this via the R functions like writeLines(), but the problem is that when the content is relatively long, or contains special characters, the character string that you would pass to writeLines() may look awkward. Below is an example of writing a long character string to a file my-file.txt: writeLines(&quot;This is a long character string. It has multiple lines. Remember to escape double quotes \\&quot;\\&quot;, but &#39;single quotes&#39; are OK. I hope you not to lose your sanity when thinking about how many backslashes you need, e.g., is it &#39;\\t&#39; or &#39;\\\\t&#39; or &#39;\\\\\\\\t&#39;?&quot;, con = &quot;my-file.txt&quot;) This problem has been greatly alleviated since R 4.0.0, because R started to support raw strings in r\"( )\" (see the help page ?Quotes), and you do not need to remember all the rules about special characters. Even with raw strings, it can still be a little distracting for readers to see a long string written to a file explicitly in a code chunk. The cat engine in knitr has provided a way for you to present text content in a code chunk and/or write it to an external file, without thinking about all the rules about R’s character strings (e.g., you need double backslashes when you need a literal backslash). To write the chunk content to a file, specify the file path in the chunk option engine.opts, e.g., engine.opts = list(file = 'path/to/file'). Under the hood, the list of values specified in engine.opts will be passed to the function base::cat(), and file is one of the arguments of base::cat(). Next we will present three examples to illustrate the use of the cat engine. 15.6.1 Write to a CSS file As shown in Section 7.3, you can embed a css code chunk in an Rmd document to style elements with CSS. An alternative way is to provide a custom CSS file to Pandoc via the css option of some R Markdown output formats such as html_document. The cat engine can be used to write this CSS file from Rmd. This example below shows how to generate a file custom.css from a chunk in the document, and pass the file path to the css option of the html_document format: --- title: &quot;Create a CSS file from a code chunk&quot; output: html_document: css: custom.css --- The chunk below will be written to `custom.css`, which will be used during the Pandoc conversion. ```{cat, engine.opts = list(file = &quot;custom.css&quot;)} h2 { color: blue; } ``` ## And this title will blue The only difference between the css code chunk approach and this approach is that the former approach writes the CSS code in place (i.e., in the place of the code chunk), which is inside the &lt;body&gt; tag of the output document, and the latter approach writes CSS to the &lt;head&gt; area of the output document. There will not be any practical visual differences in the output document. 15.6.2 Include LaTeX code in the preamble In Section 6.1, we introduced how to add LaTeX code to the preamble, which requires an external .tex file. This file can also be generated from Rmd, and here is an example: --- title: &quot;Create a .tex file from a chunk&quot; author: &quot;Jane Doe&quot; classoption: twoside output: pdf_document: includes: in_header: preamble.tex --- # How it works Write a code chunk to a file `preamble.tex` to define the header and footer of the PDF output document: ```{cat, engine.opts=list(file = &#39;preamble.tex&#39;)} \\usepackage{fancyhdr} \\usepackage{lipsum} \\pagestyle{fancy} \\fancyhead[CO,CE]{This is fancy header} \\fancyfoot[CO,CE]{And this is a fancy footer} \\fancyfoot[LE,RO]{\\thepage} \\fancypagestyle{plain}{\\pagestyle{fancy}} ``` \\lipsum[1-15] # More random content \\lipsum[16-30] In the LaTeX code in the cat code chunk above, we have defined the header and footer of the PDF document. If we also want to show the author name in the footer, we can append the author information to preamble.tex in another cat code chunk with options engine.opts = list(file = 'preamble.tex', append = TRUE) and code = sprintf('\\\\fancyfoot[LO,RE]{%s}', rmarkdown::metadata$author). To understand how this works, recall that we mentioned earlier in this section that engine.opts is passed to base::cat() (so append = TRUE is passed to cat()), and you may understand the chunk option code by reading Section 16.2. 15.6.3 Write YAML data to a file and also display it By default, the content of the cat code chunk will not be displayed in the output document. If you also want to display it after writing it out, set the chunk option class.source to a language name. The language name is used for syntax highlighting. In the example below, we specify the language to be yaml: ```{cat, engine.opts=list(file=&#39;demo.yml&#39;), class.source=&#39;yaml&#39;} a: aa: &quot;something&quot; bb: 1 b: aa: &quot;something else&quot; bb: 2 ``` Its output is displayed below, and it also generated a file demo.yml. a: aa: &quot;something&quot; bb: 1 b: aa: &quot;something else&quot; bb: 2 To show the file demo.yml is really generated, we can try to read it into R with the yaml package (Stephens and Simonov 2025): xfun::tree(yaml::read_yaml(&quot;demo.yml&quot;)) ## List of 2 ## |-a:List of 2 ## | |-aa: chr &quot;something&quot; ## | |-bb: int 1 ## |-b:List of 2 ## |-aa: chr &quot;something else&quot; ## |-bb: int 2 References "],["eng-sas.html", "15.7 Run SAS code", " 15.7 Run SAS code You may run SAS (https://www.sas.com) code using the sas engine.

Below is an example copied from the repository https://github.com/vectorgraphics/asymptote, and its output is shown in Figure 15.1: import graph3; import grid3; import palette; settings.prc = false; currentprojection=orthographic(0.8,1,2); size(500,400,IgnoreAspect); real f(pair z) {return cos(2*pi*z.x)*sin(2*pi*z.y);} surface s=surface(f,(-1/2,-1/2),(1/2,1/2),50,Spline); surface S=planeproject(unitsquare3)*s; S.colors(palette(s.map(zpart),Rainbow())); draw(S,nolight); draw(s,lightgray+opacity(0.7)); grid3(XYZgrid); FIGURE 15.1: A 3D graph made with Asymptote. Note that for PDF output, you may need some additional LaTeX packages, otherwise you may get an error that looks like this: ! LaTeX Error: File `ocgbase.sty&#39; not found. If such an error occurs, please see Section 1.3 for how to install the missing LaTeX packages. In the asy chunk above, we used the setting settings.prc = false. Without this setting, Asymptote generates an interactive 3D graph when the output format is PDF. However, the interactive graph can only be viewed in Acrobat Reader. If you use Acrobat Reader, you can interact with the graph. For example, you can rotate the 3D surface in Figure 15.1 with your mouse. 15.9.1 Generate data in R and read it in Asymptote Now we show an example in which we first save data generated in R to a CSV file (below is an R code chunk): x &lt;- seq(0, 5, l = 100) y &lt;- sin(x) writeLines(paste(x, y, sep = &quot;,&quot;), &quot;sine.csv&quot;) Then read it in Asymptote, and draw a graph based on the data as shown in Figure 15.2 (below is an asy code chunk): import graph; size(400,300,IgnoreAspect); settings.prc = false; // import data from csv file file in=input(&quot;sine.csv&quot;).line().csv(); real[][] a=in.dimension(0,0); a=transpose(a); // generate a path path rpath = graph(a[0],a[1]); path lpath = (1,0)--(5,1); // find intersection pair pA=intersectionpoint(rpath,lpath); // draw all draw(rpath,red); draw(lpath,dashed + blue); dot(&quot;$\\delta$&quot;,pA,NE); xaxis(&quot;$x$&quot;,BottomTop,LeftTicks); yaxis(&quot;$y$&quot;,LeftRight,RightTicks); FIGURE 15.2: Pass data from R to Asymptote to draw a graph. "],["eng-sass.html", "15.10 Style HTML pages with Sass/SCSS", " 15.10 Style HTML pages with Sass/SCSS Sass (https://sass-lang.com) is a CSS extension language that allows you to create CSS rules in much more flexible ways than you’d do with plain CSS. Please see its official documentation if you are interested in learning it. The R package sass (Cheng et al. 2025) can be used to compile Sass to CSS. Based on the sass package, knitr includes two language engines: sass and scss (corresponding to the Sass and SCSS syntax, respectively) to compile code chunks to CSS. Below is a scss code chunk, with the chunk header ```{scss}: $font-stack: &quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;, cursive, sans-serif; $primary-color: #00FF00; .book.font-family-1 { font: 100% $font-stack; color: $primary-color; } .book.font-family-1{font:100% \"Comic Sans MS\",cursive,sans-serif;color:lime} You can also use the sass engine, and the Sass syntax is slightly different with the SCSS syntax, e.g., ```{sass} $font-stack: &quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;, cursive, sans-serif $primary-color: #00FF00 .book.font-family-1 font: 100% $font-stack color: $primary-color ``` If you are reading the HTML version of this section, you will notice that the font for this page has been changed to Comic Sans, which might be surprising, but please do not panic—you are not having a stroke. The sass/scss code chunks are compiled through the sass::sass() function. Currently you can customize the output style for the CSS code via the chunk option engine.opts, e.g., engine.opts = list(style = \"expanded\"). The default style is “compressed.” If you are not sure what this means, please refer to the help page ?sass::sass_options and look for the output_style argument.

"],["source-script.html", "16.1 Source external R scripts", " 16.1 Source external R scripts If your R Markdown document has a large amount of code, you may consider putting some code in external R scripts, and run these scripts via source() or sys.source(), e.g., ```{r, include=FALSE} source(&quot;your-script.R&quot;, local = knitr::knit_global()) # or sys.source(&quot;your-script.R&quot;, envir = knitr::knit_global()) ``` We recommend that you use the argument local in source() or envir in sys.source() explicitly to make sure the code is evaluated in the correct environment, i.e., knitr::knit_global(). The default values for them may not be the appropriate environment: you may end up creating variables in the wrong environment, and being surprised that certain objects are not found in later code chunks. Next in the R Markdown document, you can use objects created in these scripts (e.g., data objects or functions). This way will not only make your R Markdown document cleaner, but also make it more convenient for you to develop R code (e.g., debugging R code is often easier with pure R scripts than R Markdown). Note that we used include = FALSE in the above example because we only want to execute the script without showing any output. If you do want output, you may remove this chunk option, or use the options in Section 11.7 to selectively hide or show different types of output. "],["option-code.html", "16.2 Read external scripts into a chunk", " 16.2 Read external scripts into a chunk There is a disadvantage of the source() method in Section 16.1. That is, you will not be able to see the source code by default. You can use source(..., echo = TRUE), but the source code will not be properly syntax highlighted. Besides, you need to be careful about the local argument of source(), as mentioned in Section 16.1. In this section, we introduce an alternative method that does not have these problems. Basically, when you have one or more external scripts, you may read them via the file option of a chunk. The file option can take a character vector of file paths. Below we show a few examples. You can read one external file: ```{r, file=&#39;your-script.R&#39;} ``` You can read as many scripts as you want: ```{r, file=c(&#39;one.R&#39;, &#39;two.R&#39;)} ``` You can read scripts of other languages, too. See Chapter 15 for how to use other languages in R Markdown. Here are a few more examples on non-R code. Read a Python script: ```{python, file=&#39;script.py&#39;} ``` Read a C++ file: ```{Rcpp, file=&#39;source.cpp&#39;} ``` With the file option, you can develop complicated code in your favorite editor, and read it into a code chunk of an R Markdown document. "],["read-chunk.html", "16.3 Read multiple code chunks from an external script (*)", " 16.3 Read multiple code chunks from an external script (*) In Section 16.2, we introduced a way to read code into a single code chunk. In this section, we introduce one method to read multiple code chunks from an external script. The key is that you need to label the code in the script, and you can use the same labels in the code chunks in your R Markdown document, so the code in the external script can be mapped to the code chunks via the function knitr::read_chunk(). To label a block of code in a script, you write the label after ## ---- (optionally, you can add a series of dashes to the end of this line). One script can contain multiple labeled code blocks, e.g., ## ---- test-a -------- 1 + 1 ## ---- test-b -------- if (TRUE) { plot(cars) } We assume that the filename of the above script is test.R. In the R Markdown document, we can read it via knitr::read_chunk(), and use the code in code chunks with the labels, e.g., Read an external script: ```{r, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE} knitr::read_chunk(&#39;test.R&#39;) ``` Now we can use the code, e.g., ```{r, test-a, echo=FALSE} ``` ```{r, test-b, fig.height=4} ``` Note that we use knitr::read_chunk() mainly for its side effect, so please make sure the code chunk in which you call this function is not cached (see Section 11.4 for the explanation). Like methods introduced in Section 16.1 and Section 16.2, this method also gives you the flexibility of developing code in a separate environment. "],["child-document.html", "16.4 Child documents (*)", " 16.4 Child documents (*) When you feel an R Markdown document is too long, you may consider splitting it into shorter documents, and include them as child documents of the main document via the chunk option child. The child option takes a character vector of paths to the child documents, e.g., ```{r, child=c(&#39;one.Rmd&#39;, &#39;two.Rmd&#39;)} ``` Since knitr chunk options can take values from arbitrary R expressions, one application of the child option is the conditional inclusion of a document. For example, if your report has an appendix containing technical details that your boss may not be interested in, you may use a variable to control whether this appendix is included in the report: Change `BOSS_MODE` to `TRUE` if this report is to be read by the boss: ```{r, include=FALSE} BOSS_MODE &lt;- FALSE ``` Conditionally include the appendix: ```{r, child=if (!BOSS_MODE) &#39;appendix.Rmd&#39;} ``` Or if you are writing a news report on a football game that has not taken place yet, you may include different child documents depending on the outcome, e.g., child = if (winner == 'brazil') 'brazil.Rmd' else 'germany.Rmd'. Then as soon as the game (between Germany and Brazil) is finished, you can publish your report. Another way to compile child documents is the function knitr::knit_child(). You can call this function in an R code chunk or an inline R expression, e.g., ```{r, echo=FALSE, results=&#39;asis&#39;} res &lt;- knitr::knit_child(&#39;child.Rmd&#39;, quiet = TRUE) cat(res, sep = &#39;\\n&#39;) ``` The function knit_child() returns a character vector of the knitted output, which we can write back to the main document with cat() and the chunk option results = 'asis'. You can even use a child document as a template, and call knit_child() on it repeatedly with different parameters. In the example below, we run a regression using mpg as the response variable and each of the rest of variables in the mtcars data as the explanatory variable. ```{r, echo=FALSE, results=&#39;asis&#39;} res &lt;- lapply(setdiff(names(mtcars), &#39;mpg&#39;), function(x) { knitr::knit_child(text = c( &#39;## Regression on &quot;`r x`&quot;&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &#39;```{r}&#39;, &#39;lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars[, c(&quot;mpg&quot;, x)])&#39;, &#39;```&#39;, &#39;&#39; ), envir = environment(), quiet = TRUE) }) cat(unlist(res), sep = &#39;\\n&#39;) ``` To make the above example self-contained, we used the text argument of knit_child() instead of a file input to pass the R Markdown content to be knitted. You can certainly write the content to a file, and pass a path to knit_child() instead. For example, you can save the content below to a file named template.Rmd: ## Regression on &quot;`r x`&quot; ```{r} lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars[, c(&quot;mpg&quot;, x)]) ``` And knit the file instead: res &lt;- lapply(setdiff(names(mtcars), &#39;mpg&#39;), function(x) { knitr::knit_child( &#39;template.Rmd&#39;, envir = environment(), quiet = TRUE ) }) cat(unlist(res), sep = &#39;\\n&#39;) "],["keep-files.html", "16.5 Keep the plot files", " 16.5 Keep the plot files Most R Markdown output formats use the option self_contained = TRUE by default. This causes R plots to be embedded in the output documents, so we do not need the intermediate plot files when viewing the output documents. As a consequence, the plot folder (which typically has a suffix _files) will be deleted after the Rmd document is rendered. Sometimes you may want to keep the plot files. For example, some academic journals require authors to submit figures files separately. For R Markdown, there are three ways to avoid the automatic deletion of these files: Use the option self_contained = FALSE if the output format supports this option, e.g., output: html_document: self_contained: false However, this means the plot files will not be embedded in the output document. If this is not what you want, you may consider the next two methods. Enable caching for at least one code chunk (see Section 11.4). When caching is enabled, R Markdown will not delete the plot folder. Use the option keep_md = TRUE if the output format supports this option, e.g., output: word_document: keep_md: true When you ask R Markdown to preserve the intermediate Markdown output file, it will also preserve the plot folder. "],["working-directory.html", "16.6 The working directory for R code chunks", " 16.6 The working directory for R code chunks By default, the working directory for R code chunks is the directory that contains the Rmd document. For example, if the path of an Rmd file is ~/Downloads/foo.Rmd, the working directory under which R code chunks are evaluated is ~/Downloads/. This means when you refer to external files with relative paths in code chunks, you need to know that these paths are relative to the directory of the Rmd file. With the aforementioned Rmd example file, read.csv(\"data/iris.csv\") in a code chunk means reading the CSV file ~/Downloads/data/iris.csv. When in doubt, you can add getwd() to a code chunk, compile the document, and check the output from getwd(). Sometimes you may want to use another directory as the working directory. The usual way to change the working directory is setwd(), but please note that setwd() is not persistent in R Markdown (or other types of knitr source documents), which means setwd() only works for the current code chunk, and the working directory will be restored after this code chunk has been evaluated. If you want to change the working directory for all code chunks, you may set it via a setup code chunk in the beginning of your document: ```{r, setup, include=FALSE} knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = &#39;/tmp&#39;) ``` This will change the working directory of all subsequent code chunks. If you use RStudio, you can also choose the working directory from the menu Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; R Markdown (see Figure 16.1). The default working directory is the directory of the Rmd file, and there are two other possible choices: you may use the current working directory of your R console (the option “Current”), or the root directory of the project that contains this Rmd file as the working directory (the option “Project”). FIGURE 16.1: Change the default working directory for all R Markdown documents in RStudio. In RStudio, you may also knit an individual Rmd document with a specific working directory, as shown in Figure 16.2. After you change the “Knit Directory” and click the “Knit” button, knitr will use the new working directory to evaluate your code chunks. All these settings boil down to knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = ...) as we mentioned earlier, so if you are not satisfied by any of these choices, you can specify a directory by yourself with knitr::opts_knit$set(). FIGURE 16.2: Knit an Rmd document with other possible working directories in RStudio. There is no absolutely correct choice for the working directory. Each choice has its own pros and cons: If you use the Rmd document directory as the working directory for code chunks (knitr’s default), you assume that file paths are relative to the Rmd document. This is similar to how web browsers handle relative paths, e.g., for an image &lt;img src=\"foo/bar.png\" /&gt; on an HTML page https://www.example.org/path/to/page.html, your web browser will try to fetch the image from https://www.example.org/path/to/foo/bar.png. In other words, the relative path foo/bar.png is relative to the directory of the HTML file, which is https://www.example.org/path/to/. The advantage of this approach is that you can freely move the Rmd file together with its referenced files anywhere, as long as their relative locations remain the same. For the HTML page and image example above, the files page.html and foo/bar.png could be moved together to a different directory, such as https://www.example.org/another/path/, and you will not need to update the relative path in the src attribute of &lt;img /&gt;. Some users like to think of relative paths in Rmd documents as “relative to the working directory of the R console,” as opposed to “relative to the Rmd file.” Therefore knitr’s default working directory feels confusing. The reason that I did not use the working directory of the R console as the default when I designed knitr was that users could use setwd() to change the working directory at any time. This working directory is not guaranteed to be stable. Each time a user calls setwd() in the console, there is a risk that the file paths in the Rmd document may become invalid. It could be surprising that the file paths depend on an external factor (setwd()), which is out of the control of the Rmd file. If you treat the Rmd file as “the center of the universe” when thinking of relative paths, the paths inside the Rmd file may be stabler. Furthermore, if you do not want to think too hard on relative paths, you may enter a path in RStudio using its autocomplete, as shown in Figure 16.3. RStudio will try to autocomplete a path relative to the Rmd file. Using the working directory of the R console can be a good choice for knitting documents programmatically or interactively. For example, you may knit a document multiple times in a loop, and use a different working directory each time to read a different data file (with the same filename) in that directory. This type of working directory is advocated by the ezknitr package (Attali 2023), which essentially uses knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir) to change the working directory for code chunks in knitr. Using the project directory as the working directory requires an obvious assumption: you have to use a project (e.g., an RStudio project or a version control project) in the first place, which could be a disadvantage of this approach. The advantage of this type of working directory is that all relative paths in any Rmd document are relative to the project root directory, so you do not need to think where your Rmd file is located in the project or adjust the relative paths of other files accordingly. This type of working directory is advocated by the here package (Müller 2025), which provides the function here::here() to return an absolute path by resolving a relative path passed to it (remember that the relative path is relative to the project root). The disadvantage is that when you move the referenced file together with the Rmd file to another location in the project, you need to update the referenced path in the Rmd document. When you share the Rmd file with other people, you also have to share the whole project. These types of paths are similar to absolute paths without the protocol or domain in HTML. For example, an image &lt;img src=\"/foo/bar.png\" /&gt; on the page https://www.example.org/path/to/page.html refers to the image under the root directory of the website, i.e., https://www.example.org/foo/bar.png. The leading / in the src attribute of the image indicates the root directory of the website. If you want to learn more (or further confuse yourself) about absolute and relative paths in HTML, please see Appendix B.1 of the blogdown book (Xie, Hill, and Thomas 2017). The working directory pain mainly arises from this question when dealing with relative paths: relative to what? As we mentioned earlier, different people have different preferences, and there is not an absolutely right answer. FIGURE 16.3: Autocomplete file paths in an Rmd document in RStudio. References "],["package-vignette.html", "16.7 R package vignettes", " 16.7 R package vignettes If you have experience in developing R packages, or your project requires clear documentation and rigorous tests for custom functions written in the project, you may consider organizing the project as an R package. If you do not know how to create an R package, you can easily get started in the RStudio IDE by clicking the menu File -&gt; New Project, and selecting the project type to be an R package. There are a lot of benefits of using an R package to manage a project. For example, you can place datasets in the data/ folder, write R code under R/, generate documentation (e.g., using the roxygen2 package (Wickham, Danenberg, et al. 2025)) to man/, and add unit tests to test/. When it comes to the R Markdown reports, you can write them as package vignettes under vignettes/. In the vignettes, you can load datasets and call functions in the package. When you build the package (via the command R CMD build or RStudio), vignettes will be automatically compiled. To create a package vignette in R Markdown, the easiest way is through the RStudio menu File -&gt; New File -&gt; R Markdown -&gt; From Template (see Figure 16.4). Then you select “Package Vignette” from the rmarkdown package, and you will get a vignette template. After changing the title, author, and other metadata of the template, you can start writing the content of your report. FIGURE 16.4: Create a package vignette in RStudio. Alternatively, you can install the package usethis (Wickham, Bryan, et al. 2025) and use its function usethis::use_vignette() to create a vignette skeleton. Below is what the YAML frontmatter of a package vignette typically looks like: --- title: &quot;Vignette Title&quot; author: &quot;Vignette Author&quot; output: rmarkdown::html_vignette vignette: &gt; %\\VignetteIndexEntry{Vignette Title} %\\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown} %\\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8} --- Note that you need to change the vignette title in both the title field and the \\VignetteIndexEntry{} command. Besides the above information in the vignette, you also need to do two more things in your package DESCRIPTION file: Specify VignetteBuilder: knitr in the DESCRIPTION file. Add Suggests: knitr, rmarkdown in DESCRIPTION. The vignette output format does not have to be HTML. It can also be PDF, so you can use output: pdf_document, too. Any other output formats that create HTML or PDF are also okay, such as beamer_presentation and tufte::tufte_html. However, currently, R only recognizes HTML and PDF vignettes. References "],["package-template.html", "16.8 R Markdown templates in R packages", " 16.8 R Markdown templates in R packages Figure 16.4 of Section 16.7 illustrates the process of retrieving the editable Package Vignette (HTML) template from the rmarkdown package. This R Markdown file is pre-populated with the appropriate metadata for an R package vignette. Similarly, any package may include R Markdown templates that package users can access through the RStudio IDE (as shown in the figure) or across any platform with the rmarkdown::draft() function. 16.8.1 Template use-cases Templates are a useful way to share custom structure, style, and content. There are many excellent examples of this “in the wild.” Many templates add structure and style by pre-populating the YAML metadata. We already saw an example of this with the rmarkdown package’s Package Vignette (HTML) template. Similarly, the rmdformats package (Barnier 2022) provides a number of templates that pass different custom styling functions to the output option. Other templates demonstrate document structures that the packages require. For example, the pagedown package (Xie, Lesur, et al. 2025) includes numerous templates for posters, resumes, and other page layouts. Similarly, the xaringan package’s Ninja Presentation template (Xie 2025d) demonstrates the syntax for many different slide formatting options. Templates may also demonstrate package features and syntax. For example, both the flexdashboard package (Aden-Buie et al. 2026) and the learnr package (Aden-Buie et al. 2025) include templates with code chunks that call functions from the packages to create a sample dashboard or tutorial, respectively. Similarly, templates may also include boilerplate content. For example, the rticles package (Allaire et al. 2024) provides many such templates to align R Markdown output to the required style and content guidelines of different academic journals. Boilerplate content is also useful in organizational settings, such as a team generating quarterly reports. 16.8.2 Template setup The usethis package (Wickham, Bryan, et al. 2025) has a helpful function for creating templates. Running usethis::use_rmarkdown_template(\"Template Name\") will automatically create the required directory structure and files (you should provide your own Template Name). If you wish to set up your template manually instead, create a subdirectory of the inst/rmarkdown/templates directory. Within this directory, you need to save at least two files: A file named template.yaml, which gives the RStudio IDE basic metadata such as a human-readable name for the template. At a minimum, this file should have the name and description fields, e.g., name: Example Template description: What this template does You may include create_dir: true if you want a new directory to be created when the template is selected. This is useful if your template relies upon additional resources. For example, the learnr package template sets create_dir: true, whereas the flexdashboard package template uses the default create_dir: false. You may attempt to open both of these templates in RStudio to notice the different user prompts. An R Markdown document saved under skeleton/skeleton.Rmd. This may contain anything you wish to put in an R Markdown document. Optionally, the skeleton folder may also include additional resources like style sheets or images used by your template. These files will be loaded to the user’s computer along with the template.

For example, if you want to write a book, you can write each chapter in its own Rmd file, and use bookdown to compile these Rmd files into a book. For RStudio users, the easiest way to get started is to create a bookdown project with the IDE by selecting File -&gt; New Project -&gt; New Directory -&gt; Book Project using bookdown, as you can see from Figure 16.5. If you do not use RStudio or if you prefer to work from the console, you may produce the same result by calling the function bookdown:::bookdown_skeleton('your-book-dir'). FIGURE 16.5: Create a bookdown project in RStudio. To demonstrate the usage, we provide a minimal example consisting of three files within the same directory: directory |- index.Rmd |- 01-intro.Rmd |- 02-analysis.Rmd Below we show the content of each file and explain their roles. index.Rmd: --- title: &quot;A Minimal bookdown Project&quot; site: bookdown::bookdown_site output: bookdown::gitbook --- # Preface {-} Some content The first file is typically called index.Rmd. It should be the only Rmd file in which you provide the YAML frontmatter. It should also include a special YAML field site: bookdown::bookdown_site, so that rmarkdown knows to use bookdown to build all Rmd files, instead of rendering a single Rmd file. You can use any bookdown output formats, such as bookdown::gitbook, bookdown::pdf_book, bookdown::word_document2, and bookdown::epub_book. The next two Rmd files are two chapters: 01-intro.Rmd: # Chapter 1 This is chapter 1. 02-analysis.Rmd: # Chapter 2 This is chapter 2. To render these Rmd files, you should call bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd') instead of rmarkdown::render(). Under the hood, bookdown merges all Rmd files into a single Rmd by default and compiles it. Files are merged in alphabetical order. That is why we added numeric prefixes to filenames in the above example. There are a lot of settings that you can customize for a bookdown project.

You can also restart the R session by Ctrl + Alt + F10 (or Command + Option + F10 on macOS). Restarting regularly is helpful for reproducibility, because results are more likely to be reproducible if they are computed from a new R session. This can also be done through the drop-down menu Restart R and Run All Chunks behind the Run button on the toolbar. "],["spell-check.html", "17.2 Spell-check R Markdown", " 17.2 Spell-check R Markdown If you use the RStudio IDE, you can press the F7 key or click the menu Edit -&gt; Check Spelling to spell-check an Rmd document. Real-time spell checking has become available in RStudio v1.3, so you no longer need to manually trigger spell checking with this version or a later version of RStudio. If you do not use RStudio, the spelling package (Ooms and Hester 2025) has a function spell_check_files(), which can check the spelling of common document formats, including R Markdown. When spell checking Rmd documents, it will skip code chunks and only check ordinary text. References "],["rmarkdown-render.html", "17.3 Render R Markdown with rmarkdown::render()", " 17.3 Render R Markdown with rmarkdown::render() If you do not use RStudio or any other IDE, you need to know this fact: R Markdown documents are rendered through the function rmarkdown::render(). This means you can programmatically render an R Markdown document in any R script. For example, you could render a series of reports in a for-loop for each state of a country: for (state in state.name) { rmarkdown::render( &#39;input.Rmd&#39;, output_file = paste0(state, &#39;.html&#39;) ) } The output filename will be different for each state. You can also make use of the state variable in the document input.Rmd, e.g., --- title: &quot;A report for `r state`&quot; output: html_document --- The area of `r state` is `r state.area[state.name == state]` square miles. You may read the help page ?rmarkdown::render to know other possible arguments. Here we just want to mention two of them, i.e., the clean and envir arguments. The former (clean) is particularly helpful for debugging when anything goes wrong with the Pandoc conversion. If you call rmarkdown::render(..., clean = FALSE), all intermediate files will be preserved, including the intermediate .md file knitted from the .Rmd file. If Pandoc signals an error, you may start debugging from this .md file. The latter (envir) offers a way to render a document with the guarantee of an empty new environment when you call rmarkdown::render(..., envir = new.env()), so objects created in your code chunks will stay inside this environment, without polluting your current global environment. On the other hand, if you prefer rendering the Rmd document in a new R session so that objects in your current R session will not pollute your Rmd document, you may call rmarkdown::render in xfun::Rscript_call(), e.g., xfun::Rscript_call( rmarkdown::render, list(input = &#39;my-file.Rmd&#39;, output_format = &#39;pdf_document&#39;) ) This method is similar to clicking the Knit button in RStudio, which also renders the Rmd document in a new R session. In case you need to render an Rmd document inside another Rmd document, we strongly recommend that you use this method instead of directly calling rmarkdown::render() in a code chunk, because rmarkdown::render() creates and relies on a lot of side effects internally, which may affect rendering other Rmd documents in the same R session. The second argument of xfun::Rscript_call() takes a list of arguments to be passed to rmarkdown::render(). In fact, xfun::Rscript_call is a general-purpose function to call any R function (with arguments optionally) in a new R session. Please see its help page if you are interested. "],["parameterized-reports.html", "17.4 Parameterized reports", " 17.4 Parameterized reports In Section 17.3, we mentioned one way to render a series of reports in a for-loop. In fact, rmarkdown::render() has an argument named params specifically designed for this task. You can parameterize your report through this argument. When you specify parameters for a report, you can use the variable params in your report. For example, if you call: for (state in state.name) { rmarkdown::render(&#39;input.Rmd&#39;, params = list(state = state)) } then in input.Rmd, the object params will be a list that contains the state variable: --- title: &quot;A report for `r params$state`&quot; output: html_document --- The area of `r params$state` is `r state.area[state.name == params$state]` square miles. Another way to specify parameters for a report is to use the YAML field params, e.g., --- title: Parameterized reports output: html_document params: state: Nebraska year: 2019 midwest: true --- Note that you can include as many parameters in the params YAML field or the params argument of rmarkdown::render(). If both the YAML field and the argument are present, the parameter values in the argument will override the corresponding parameters in YAML. For example, when we call rmarkdown::render(..., params = list(state = 'Iowa', year = 2018) on the previous example that has the params field, params$state will become Iowa (instead of Nebraska) and params$year will become 2018 (instead of 2019) in the R Markdown document. When rendering the same R Markdown document to a series of reports, you need to adjust the output_file argument of rmarkdown::render(), to make sure each report has its unique filename. Otherwise, you will accidentally override certain report files. For example, you can write a function to generate a report for each state and each year: render_one &lt;- function(state, year) { # assuming the output format of input.Rmd is PDF rmarkdown::render( &#39;input.Rmd&#39;, output_file = paste0(state, &#39;-&#39;, year, &#39;.pdf&#39;), params = list(state = state, year = year), envir = parent.frame() ) } Then you can use nested for-loops to generate all reports: for (state in state.name) { for (year in 2000:2020) { render_one(state, year) } } At the end, you will get a series of report files like Alabama-2000.pdf, Alabama-2001.pdf, …, Wyoming-2019.pdf, and Wyoming-2020.pdf. For parameterized reports, you can also input parameters interactively through a graphical user interface (GUI) created from Shiny. This requires you to provide a params field in YAML, and rmarkdown will automatically create the GUI using the appropriate input widgets for each parameter (e.g., a checkbox will be provided for a Boolean parameter). To start the GUI, you can call rmarkdown::render() with params = 'ask' if you do not use RStudio: rmarkdown::render(&quot;input.Rmd&quot;, params = &quot;ask&quot;) If you use RStudio, you can click the menu Knit with Parameters behind the Knit button. Figure 17.1 shows an example GUI for parameters. FIGURE 17.1: Knit an R Markdown document with parameters that you can input from a GUI. For more information on parameterized reports, you may read Chapter 15 of the R Markdown Definitive Guide (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018). References "],["custom-knit.html", "17.5 Customize the Knit button (*)", " 17.5 Customize the Knit button (*) When you click the Knit button in RStudio, it will call the rmarkdown::render() function in a new R session and output a file of the same base name as the input file in the same directory. For example, knitting example.Rmd with the output format html_document will create an output file example.html. There may be situations in which we want to customize how the document is rendered. For example, perhaps we would like the rendered document to contain the current date, or would like to output the compiled report into a different directory. Although we can achieve these goals by calling rmarkdown::render() (see Section 17.3) with the appropriate output_file argument, it can be inconvenient to have to rely on a custom call to rmarkdown::render() to compile your report. It is possible to control the behavior of the Knit button by providing the knit field within the YAML frontmatter of your document. The field takes a function with the main argument input (the path to the input Rmd document) and other arguments that are currently ignored. You can either write the source code of the function directly in the knit field, or put the function elsewhere (e.g., in an R package) and call the function in the knit field. If you routinely need the custom knit function, we would recommend that you put it in a package, instead of repeating its source code in every single R Markdown document. If you store the code directly within YAML, you must wrap the entire function in parentheses. If the source code has multiple lines, you have to indent the first line by exactly two spaces and all other lines by at least two spaces. For example, if we want the output filename to include the date on which it is rendered, we could use the following YAML code in the Rmd document header: --- knit: | (function(input, ...) { rmarkdown::render( input, output_file = paste0( xfun::sans_ext(input), &#39;-&#39;, Sys.Date(), &#39;.html&#39; ), envir = globalenv() ) }) --- For example, if we knit example.Rmd on 2019-07-29, the output filename will be example-2019-07-29.html. While the above approach looks simple and straightforward enough, embedding a function directly in your YAML may make it difficult for you to maintain it, unless the function is only to be used once with a single R Markdown document. In general, we would recommend using an R package to maintain such a function, e.g., you may create a function knit_with_date() in a package: #&#39; Custom Knit function for RStudio #&#39; #&#39; @export knit_with_date &lt;- function(input, ...) { rmarkdown::render( input, output_file = paste0( xfun::sans_ext(input), &#39;-&#39;, Sys.Date(), &#39;.&#39; ), envir = globalenv() ) } If you add the above code to a package named myPackage, you will be able to refer to your custom knit function using the following YAML setting: --- knit: myPackage::knit_with_date --- You may refer to the help page ?rmarkdown::render to find out more ideas on how you could customize your knit function behind the Knit button in RStudio. "],["google-drive.html", "17.6 Collaborate on Rmd documents through Google Drive with trackdown", " 17.6 Collaborate on Rmd documents through Google Drive with trackdown The trackdown package (Kothe et al. 2021) offers a simple solution for collaborative writing and editing of R Markdown (or Sweave) documents. Based on the googledrive package (D’Agostino McGowan and Bryan 2025), trackdown allows to upload the local .Rmd (or .Rnw) file as a plain-text file to Google Drive. By taking advantage of the easily readable Markdown (or LaTeX) syntax and the well-known online interface offered by Google Docs, collaborators can easily contribute to the writing and editing process. After integrating all authors’ contributions, the final document can be downloaded and rendered locally. You can install trackdown from CRAN, or you may try the development version on GitHub (https://github.com/claudiozandonella/trackdown): # install from CRAN install.packages(&quot;trackdown&quot;) # install the development version remotes::install_github(&quot;claudiozandonella/trackdown&quot;, build_vignettes = TRUE) The package documentation is available at https://claudiozandonella.github.io/trackdown/. 17.6.1 The trackdown Workflow During the collaborative writing/editing of an .Rmd (or .Rnw) document, it is important to employ different workflows for computer code and narrative text: Code - Collaborative code writing is done most efficiently by following a traditional Git-based workflow using an online repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab). Narrative Text - Collaborative writing of narrative text is done most efficiently using Google Docs which provides a familiar and simple online interface that allows multiple users to simultaneously write/edit the same document. Thus, the workflow’s main idea is simple: Upload the .Rmd (or .Rnw) document to Google Drive to collaboratively write/edit the narrative text in Google Docs; download the document locally to continue working on the code while harnessing the power of Git for version control and collaboration. This iterative process of uploading to and downloading from Google Drive continues until the desired results are obtained (See Figure 17.2). The workflow can be summarized as: Collaborative code writing using Git &amp; collaborative writing of narrative text using Google Docs For a detailed example of the workflow see https://claudiozandonella.github.io/trackdown/articles/trackdown-workflow.html. FIGURE 17.2: trackdown workflow, collaborative code writing is done locally using Git whereas collaborative writing of the narrative text is done online using Google Docs Functions and Special Features trackdown offers different functions to manage the workflow: upload_file() uploads a file for the first time to Google Drive. update_file() updates the content of an existing file in Google Drive with the contents of a local file. download_file() downloads the edited version of a file from Google Drive and updates the local version. render_file() downloads a file from Google Drive and renders it locally. Moreover, trackdown offers additional features to facilitate the collaborative writing and editing of documents in Google Docs. In particular, it is possible to: Hide Code: Code in the header of the document (YAML header or LaTeX preamble) and code chunks are removed from the document when uploading to Google Drive and are automatically restored during download. This prevents collaborators from inadvertently making changes to the code which might corrupt the file and allows them to focus on the narrative text. Upload Output: The actual output document (i.e., the rendered file) can be uploaded to Google Drive in conjunction with the .Rmd (or .Rnw) document. This helps collaborators to evaluate the overall layout including figures and tables and allows them to add comments to suggest and discuss changes. Use Google Drive shared drives: The documents can be uploaded to either a personal Google Drive or to a shared drive to facilitate collaboration. Advantages of Google Docs Google Docs offers users a familiar, intuitive, and free web-based interface that allows multiple users to simultaneously write/edit the same document. In Google Docs it is possible to: track changes (incl. accepting/rejecting suggestions) add comments to suggest and discuss changes check spelling and grammar errors (potentially integrating third-party services like Grammarly) Moreover, Google Docs allows anyone to contribute to the writing/editing of the document. No programming experience is required, users can just focus on writing/editing the narrative text. Note that not all collaborators have to have a Google account (although this is recommended to utilize all Google Docs features). Only the person who manages the trackdown workflow needs to have a Google account to upload files to Google Drive. Other collaborators can be invited to contribute to the document using a shared link. References "],["workflowr.html", "17.7 Organize an R Markdown project into a research website with workflowr", " 17.7 Organize an R Markdown project into a research website with workflowr The workflowr package (J. Blischak, Carbonetto, and Stephens 2025; J. D. Blischak, Carbonetto, and Stephens 2019) can help you organize a (data analysis) project with a project template and the version control tool GIT. Every time you make a change to the project, you can log the change, and workflowr can build a website corresponding to that particular version of your project. This means that you will be able to view the full history of your analysis results. Although this package uses GIT as the backend for version control, you do not really have to be familiar with GIT. The package provides R functions that do the GIT operations under the hood, and you only need to call these R functions. Furthermore, workflowr automates best practices for reproducible code. Each time an R Markdown document is rendered, workflowr automatically sets a seed with set.seed(), records the session information with sessionInfo(), and scans for absolute file paths, etc. Please see the package documentation for how to get started and more information. The main author of workflowr, John Blischak, has also put together a non-exhaustive list of R packages and guides related to the workflow of R projects, which can be found in this GitHub repo: https://github.com/jdblischak/r-project-workflows.
