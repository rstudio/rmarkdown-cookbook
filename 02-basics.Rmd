# Basics

This book by no means intends to be a comprehensive guide to R Markdown. However, it is important to provide an overview of the R Markdown ecosystem before we drill down to specific examples and recipes. This chapter aims to provide the basic concepts required for the book.

For those seeking the background, we recommend that readers refer to the R Markdown definitive guide [@xie2018], which provides a comprehensive overview of the R Markdown components.

## R Markdown components

R Markdown combines several different processes together to create documents, and one of the main sources of confusion from R Markdown is how all the components work together. Fortunately, as a user, it is not essential to understand all the inner workings of these processes to be able to create documents. However, as a user who may be seeking to alter the behavior of a document, it is important to understand which component is responsible for what. This makes it a lot easier to seek help as you can target your searches on the correct area.

The basic workflow structure for an R Markdown document is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:rmdworkflow), highlighting the steps (arrows) and the intermediate files that are created before producing the output. The whole process is implemented via the function `rmarkdown::render()`. Each stage is explained in further detail below.

```{r rmdworkflow, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A diagram illustrating how an R Markdown document is converted to the final output document.", out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/workflow.png", dpi = NA)
```

The `.Rmd` document is the original format of the document. It contains a combination of YAML (metadata), text (narratives), and code chunks.

First, the `knit()` function in **knitr** is used to execute all code embedded within the `.Rmd` file, and prepare the code output to be displayed within the output document. All these results are converted into the correct markup language to be contained within the temporary `.md` file.

Then the `.md` file is processed by [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), a multipurpose tool designed to convert files from one markup language to another. It takes any parameters specified within the YAML frontmatter of the document (e.g., `title`, `author`, and `date`) to convert the document to the output format specified in the `output` parameter (such as `html_document` for HTML output).

If the output format is PDF, there is an additional layer of processing, as Pandoc will convert the intermediate `.md` file into an intermediate `.tex` file. This file is then processed by [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) to form the final PDF document. As we mentioned in Section \@ref(install-latex), the **rmarkdown** package calls the `latexmk()` function in the **tinytex** package [@R-tinytex], which in turn calls LaTeX to compile `.tex` to `.pdf`.

In short, `rmarkdown::render()` = `knitr::knit()` + Pandoc (+ LaTeX for PDF output only).

Robin Linacre has written a nice summary of the relationship between R Markdown, **knitr**, and Pandoc at https://stackoverflow.com/q/40563479/559676, which contains more technical details than the above overview.

## Render an R script to a report {#spin}

Even if you are a long-time R Markdown user, you may have missed another possibility. Dean Attali called it ["**knitr**'s best hidden gem"](https://deanattali.com/2015/03/24/knitrs-best-hidden-gem-spin/). That is, you can render a pure R script to a report directly. If you use the RStudio IDE, the keyboard shortcut to render R scripts is the same as when you knit Rmd documents (`Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + K`).

When rendering an R script to a report, the function `knitr::spin()` is called to convert the R script to an Rmd file first. This function is what Dean Attali called **knitr**'s best hidden gem. You will see all text and graphical output in the report.

If you want granular control over the elements in the report, below are a few syntax rules to help you:

- Roxygen comments will be treated as normal text. A roxygen comment is an R comment that starts with `#'`. This can help you write narratives in your report. You can use any Markdown syntax in the comments.

- A comment starting with `#+` is treated as the **knitr** chunk header. For example, `knitr::spin()` will translate the comment `#+ label, fig.width=5` to the chunk header ```` ```{r label, fig.width=5}```` in R Markdown.

- R code of the form `{{ code }}` is translated to an inline R expression in R Markdown. Please note that `{{ code }}` must be on its own line.

- The YAML frontmatter can be written in the beginning of the R script in roxygen comments, too.

- Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored (i.e., they are treated as true comments).

Below is a full example illustrating the above rules:

`r import_example('spin.R')`

When this script is rendered to a report, `knitr::spin()` will convert it to R Markdown:

```{r, class.output='md', comment='', echo=FALSE}
xfun::raw_string(
  knitr::spin(text = xfun::read_utf8('examples/spin.R'), knit = FALSE)
)
```

This method of generating reports can be particularly useful when you primarily work with R scripts and do not need a lot of narratives. If the proportion of text is substantial in your report, R Markdown may be a better choice, because you do not need to put all text in roxygen comments.

## Convert R Markdown to R script {#purl}

When you want to extract all R code from an R Markdown document, you can call the function `knitr::purl()`. Below is a simple Rmd example with the filename `purl.Rmd`:

`r import_example('purl.Rmd')`

If we call `knitr::purl("purl.Rmd")`, it generates the following R script (with the filename `purl.R` by default):

```{r, class.output='r', comment='', echo=FALSE}
xfun::raw_string(
  knitr::purl(text = xfun::read_utf8('examples/purl.Rmd'), quiet = TRUE)
)
```

The above R script contains the chunk options in a comment. If you want pure R code, you may call `knitr::purl()` with the argument `documentation = 0`, which will generate the R script below:

```{r, class.output='r', comment='', echo=FALSE}
xfun::raw_string(
  knitr::purl(text = xfun::read_utf8('examples/purl.Rmd'), quiet = TRUE, documentation = 0)
)
```

If you want to retain all the text, you may use the argument `documentation = 2`, which generates the R script below:

```{r, class.output='r', comment='', echo=FALSE}
xfun::raw_string(
  knitr::purl(text = xfun::read_utf8('examples/purl.Rmd'), quiet = TRUE, documentation = 2)
)
```

Note that code chunks with the option `purl = FALSE` will be excluded in the R script.

Inline R expresions are ignored by default. If you want to include them in the R script, you need to set the global R option `options(knitr.purl.inline = TRUE)` before calling `knitr::purl()`.
