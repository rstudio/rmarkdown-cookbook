# Formatting

The greatest strength of the Markdown language is that its simplicity makes it very easy to read and write even to newcomers. This is one of its key design principles, and as outlined creator of the original Markdown language:

> A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.
>
> --- [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy)

However, this comes at a cost of customization. Many features of typical word processors are not directly available in Markdown. These include:

- Changing the font size of a piece of text;

- Changing the font color of certain words;

- Specifying text alignment.

We leave it to you to decide whether such features are worth your effort. To some degree, Markdown reflects the philosophy of Stoicism: the "natural world" consists of plain text, and you should not be controlled by the desire for (visual) pleasure. Anyway, this chapter offers some tips on how you can customize the appearance and styling of elements in an R Markdown document.

If you need a reminder in the basics of the Markdown language, the R Markdown cheatsheet at https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/ provides a good overview of the basic syntax.

## Font color {#font-color}
<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29067541/rmarkdown-how-to-change-the-font-color -->

The Markdown syntax has no built-in method for changing text colors. We can use HTML and LaTeX syntax to change the formatting of words:

- For HTML, we can wrap the text in the `<font>` tag, e.g., `<font color="red">text</font>`.

- For PDF, we can use the LaTeX command `\textcolor{}{}`. This requires the extra LaTeX package **xcolor**.

As an example of changing the color in PDF text:

```text
---
output:
  pdf_document:
    extra_dependencies: ["xcolor"]
---

Roses are \textcolor{red}{red}, violets are \textcolor{blue}{blue}.
```

If you want to design an R Markdown document for multiple output formats, you should not embed raw HTML or LaTeX code in your document, because they will be ignored in the other output formats (e.g., LaTeX code will be ignored in HTML output). We can write a custom function to insert the correct syntax depending on the output format using the `is_latex_output()` and `is_html_output()` functions in **knitr** as follows:

```{r}
colorize = function(x, color){
  if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
    sprintf("\\textcolor{%s}{%s}", color, x)
  } else if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
    sprintf("<font color='%s'>%s</font>", color, x)
  } else x
}
```

We can then use the code as an inline R expression `colorize("some words in red", "red")` which will create `r colorize("some words in red", "red")` (you may not see the red color if you are reading this book printed in black and white).

## Indent text

<!-- PROBLEM: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47087557/indent-without-adding-a-bullet-point-or-number-in-rmarkdown/52570150#52570150 -->
<!-- SOLUTION: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html%23raw-tex#line_blocks -->

As mentioned in Section \@ref(linebreaks), whitespaces are often meaningless in Markdown. Markdown will also ignore spaces used for indentation by default. However, we may want to keep the indentation in certain cases, e.g., in verses and addresses. In these situations, we can use line blocks by starting the line with a vertical bar (`|`). The linebreaks and any leading spaces will be preserved in the output. For example:^[This is a limerick written by Claus Ekstrøm: https://yihui.name/en/2018/06/xaringan-math-limerick/.]

```md
| When dollars appear it's a sign
|   that your code does not quite align  
| Ensure that your math  
|   in xaringan hath  
|   been placed on a single long line
```

The output is:

> | When dollars appear it's a sign
|   that your code does not quite align  
| Ensure that your math  
|   in xaringan hath  
|   been placed on a single long line


The lines can be hard-wrapped in the Markdown source. If the continuation line begins with a space, the previous linebreak and the leading spaces on this line will be ignored as usual. For example:

```md
| Hiring Manager
| School of Ninja,
  Hacker's University
| 404 Not Found Road,
  Undefined 0x1234, NA
```

The output is:

> | Hiring Manager
> | School of Ninja,
>  Hacker's University
> | 404 Not Found Road,
>  Undefined 0x1234, NA

You can see that the linebreak after "School of Ninja" was ignored.

## Verbatim code chunks

Typically we write code chunks and inline expressions that we want to be parsed and evaluated by **knitr**. However, if you are trying to write a tutorial on using **knitr**, you may need to generate verbatim code chunk or inline expression that is _not_ parsed by **knitr**, and we want to display the content of the chunk header. 

Unfortunately, we can't wrap the code chunk in another layer of backticks, but instead we must make the code chunk invalid within the source code by inserting  "`` `r ''` `` to the chunk header. This will be evaluated as an inline expression to _an empty string_ by **knitr**. For this example, the following "code chunk" in the source document:

````{r echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
cat("`r ''````{r, eval=TRUE}
1 + 1
```")
````

will be rendered as:

````
```{r, eval=TRUE}`r ''`
1 + 1
```
````

in the output. The inline expression is gone because it is substituted by an empty string. However, that is only the first step. To show something verbatim in the output, the syntax in Markdown is to wrap it in a code block (indent by four spaces or use backtick fences). This will be the actual source if you want to see the output above:

```{r echo = FALSE, comment = NA}
cat("````
```{r, eval=TRUE}`r ''`
1 + 1
```\n````")
```

Why four backticks? That is because you have to use at least N+1 backticks to wrap up N backticks.

### Show a verbatim inline expression

There are multiple ways to show a verbatim inline expression. I mentioned this trick for R Markdown documents in the FAQ:

```md
This will show a verbatim inline R expression `` `r
1+1` `` in the output.
```

The trick works due to two reasons (1) a single line break is often the same as a space to Markdown parsers (by comparison, two consecutive line breaks means starting a new paragraph); (2) **knitr** requires a space after `` `r `` to parse it; if the space is missing, it will not be treated as an inline expression. In the output document, you should see:

```
This will show a verbatim inline R expression `r 1+1` in the output.
```

You can read more about this behavior [here](https://yihui.name/en/2017/11/knitr-verbatim-code-chunk/).

## Multi-column layout

Pandoc's Markdown supports the multi-column layout for slides but not other types of documents. In this recipe, we show how to use the multi-column layout in normal HTML documents and LaTeX documents. This recipe was inspired by Atsushi Yasumoto's solutions to the **knitr** issue https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1743.

The recipe will be much simpler if you only need to consider HTML output, because arranging HTML elements side by side is relatively simple via CSS. It will be even simpler if you only need to arrange the text output of a code chunk side by side. Below is the first example:

````md
---
output: html_document
---

```{r attr.source="style='display:inline-block;'", collapse=TRUE}`r ''`
1:10  # a sequence from 1 to 10
10:1  # in the reverse order
```
````

The CSS attribute `display: inline-block;` means the output code blocks (i.e., the `<pre>` tags in HTML) should be displayed as inline elements. By default, these blocks are displayed as block-level elements (i.e., `display: block;`) and will occupy whole rows. The chunk option `collapse = TRUE` means the text output will be merged into the R source code block, so both the source and its text output will be placed in the same `<pre>` block.

If you want to arrange arbitrary content side by side in HTML output, you can use Pandoc's [fenced `Div`](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#divs-and-spans). The name "Div" comes from the HTML tag `<div>`, but you can interpret it as an arbitrary block or container. A `Div` starts and ends with three or more colons (e.g., `:::`). A `Div` with more colons can contain `Div`s with fewer colons. An important and useful feature of the fenced `Div` is that you can attach attributes to it. For example, you can apply the CSS attribute `display: flex;` to an outside container, so that the inside containers will be placed side by side:

`r import_example('multicol-html.Rmd')`

In the above example, the outside `Div` (`::::`) contains two `Div`s (`:::`). You can certainly add more `Div`s inside. To learn more about the very powerful CSS attribute `display: flex;` (CSS Flexbox), you may read the guide at https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/. The CSS Grid (`display: grid;`) is also very powerful and can be used in the above example, too. If you want to try it, you may change `display: flex;` to `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;`. See the guide at https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/ if you want to learn more about the grid layout.

It is trickier if you want the layout to work for both HTML and LaTeX output. We show a full example below that works for HTML document, LaTeX document, and Beamer presentation output:

`r import_example('multicol.Rmd')`

```{r, multicol, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='A two-column layout that works for HTML, LaTeX, and Beamer output.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/multicol.png', dpi = NA)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:multicol) shows the output. In this example, we used an outside `Div` with the class `.columns` and three inside `Div`s with the class `.column`. For HTML output, we introduced an external CSS file `columns.css`, in which we applied the Flexbox layout to the outside `Div` so the inside `Div`s can be placed side by side:

`r import_example('columns.css')`

For Beamer output, there is nothing we need to do, because the LaTeX class `beamer.cls` has defined environments `columns` and `column`. They will just work.

For LaTeX output (`pdf_document`), we have to introduce some dirty hacks stored in `columns.tex` to the LaTeX preamble to define the LaTeX environments `columns` and `column`:

`r import_example('columns.tex')`

The `column` environment is particularly complicated mainly because Pandoc starts a new paragraph for each `Div` in LaTeX output, and we have to remove these new paragraphs, otherwise the `Div`s cannot be placed side by side. The hacks were borrowed from https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/179016/9128.
