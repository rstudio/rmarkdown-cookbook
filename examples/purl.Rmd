title: Use `purl()` to extract R code
---

The function `knitr::purl()` extracts R code chunks from
a **knitr** document and save the code to an R script.

Below is a simple chunk:

```{r, simple, echo=TRUE}
1 + 1
```

Inline R expressions like `r 2 * pi` are ignored by default.

If you do not want certain code chunks to be extracted,
you can set the chunk option `purl = FALSE`, e.g.,

```{r, ignored, purl=FALSE}
x = rnorm(1000)
```
