A note box:

::: {.noteblock data-latex=""}
Thank you for noticing this **new notice**! Your noticing it has
been noted, and _will be reported to the authorities_!
:::

We define an R function `box_args()` to generate the arguments
for the box:

```{r}
box_args <- function(
  vrulecolor = 'white',
  hrule = c('\\abLongLine', '\\abShortLine', ''),
  title = '', vrulewidth = '0pt',
  icon = 'Bomb', iconcolor = 'black'
) {
  hrule <- match.arg(hrule)
  sprintf(
    '[%s][%s][\\textbf{%s}]{%s}{\\fa%s}{%s}',
    vrulecolor, hrule, title, vrulewidth, icon, iconcolor
  )
}
```

Pass some arguments to the `awesomeblock` environment through
an inline R expression:

::: {.awesomeblock data-latex="`r box_args(title = 'NOTICE!')`"}
Thank you for noticing this **new notice**!
