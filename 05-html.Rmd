# HTML Output

How to customise the appearance of HTML outputs.

## Change Chunk Styling {#chunk-styling}

<!--- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41030477/changing-chunk-background-color-in-rmarkdown --->

We can customize the style of code chunks and outputs using the arguments `class.source` and `class.output`. One way this can be useful is motivated by the original [Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/41030477/559676) on how we use **knitr** to help us to emphasize "bad" coding practices.

By default,  R Markdown will include the Bootstrap framework. This can make things very easy for you to signify your code and your output. Bootstrap defines some [CSS classes for backgrounds](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes-backgrounds): `"bg-primary"`, `"bg-success"`, `"bg-info"`, `"bg-warning"`, and `"bg-danger"`.

For example, we are warned that the normal subsetting of a data frame can be type-unstable. To show this here,  the chunk options are set: `class.source = 'bg-warning', class.output = 'bg-warning'`.

````
```{r df-drop, class.source='bg-warning', class.output='bg-warning'}`r ''`
mtcars[, "mpg"]
```
````

In our output document, this will create the code chunk as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:bgWarning).

```{r bgWarning, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Output of customised code chunk"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bgWarning.png", dpi = NA)
```

To make sure that we return a data frame, we set the argument `drop = FALSE`. Here the chunk options are set: `class.source = 'bg-success', class.output = 'bg-success'`.

````
```{r df-drop-ok, class.source='bg-success', class.output='bg-success'}`r ''`
mtcars[, "mpg", drop=FALSE]
```
````

### Using Custom CSS

If we wish to specify custom styling options, we can include a CSS file by setting a parameter in the YAML header ([reference](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/html_document_format.html#custom_css)). You can also include a chunk of CSS code, as is done here. Note that for this example, only `class.source` is set.

````
```{css echo=FALSE}`r ''`
.chunk-style{
  background-color: #F5B7B1;
  border: 1px solid #797D7F;
  border-radius: 1px;}
```

```{r df-drop-2, class.source='chunk-style'}`r ''`
mtcars[, "mpg"] 
``` 
````

The output style is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:bgCustom).

```{r bgCustom, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Custom Background styling as defined by CSS"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bgCustom.png", dpi = NA)
```

### Setting Default Style for Document

If we wish for all code chunks in the document to use our newly created style, we can add the `class.source` to the global knitr options.:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(class.source='chunk-style')
```




## Scrollable Code Chunks {#html-scroll}

If we are including large amounts of code within our documents, we may want the code chunks to be limited in height with a scroll bar to navigate through the full details. Such a code chunk is highlighted in Figure \@ref(fig:scrollableCode). Here we demonstrate several ways in which this behaviour could be implemented.

```{r scrollableCode, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A Scrollable Code chunk using custom CSS"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/scrollableCode.png", dpi = NA)
```

### Overwriting the Default CSS

The simplist way of adding a scroll bar is to overwrite the global CSS options for the document. This will change the behaviour of all code chunks within the document. This requires us to specify the following CSS, where the user can set the height of the box using the `max-height` option:

```{css, eval = FALSE}
pre {
  max-height: 300px;
  float: left;
  width: 910px;
  overflow-y: auto;
}

pre.r {
  max-height: none;
}
```

### Specifing Additional CSS

If you would desire more control over when the scroll bar is used, you may prefer to specify another style class which we can used when required. Below, we have created an additional class called 'scroll' which we can include within our R Markdown document:

```{css, eval = FALSE}
.scroll {
  max-height: 300px;
  float: left;
  width: 910px;
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

To use this class, we can specify the 'class.output' option within the code chunk header:

````
```{r, class.output = "scroll"}`r ''`
print(cars)
```
````

### User-specified chunk height

This example is extended further within Section \@ref(hooks-scroll), which uses chunk hooks to allow for user-specified heights.
