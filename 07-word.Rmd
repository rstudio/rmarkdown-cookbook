# Word

To generate a Word document from R Markdown, you can use the output format `word_document`. If you want to include cross-references in the document, you may consider the output format `bookdown::word_document2`, as mentioned in Section \@ref(cross-ref).

```yaml
---
output:
  word_document: default
  bookdown::word_document2: default  # for cross-references
---
```

From our experience, the most frequently asked questions about Word output are:

1. How to apply a custom Word template to the document?

1. How to incorporate changes made in Word into the original R Markdown document?

1. How to style individual document elements?

We will address these questions in this chapter.

## Custom Word templates {#word-template}

You can apply the styles defined in a Word template document to new Word documents generated from R Markdown. Such a template document is also called a "style reference document". The key is that you have to create this template document from Pandoc first, and change the style definitions in it later. Then pass the path of this template to the `reference_docx` option of `word_document`, e.g.,

```yaml
---
output:
  word_document:
    reference_docx: "template.docx"
---
```

As we just mentioned, the document `template.docx` has to be generated from Pandoc. You can create this template from an arbitrary R Markdown document with the `word_document` output format (the actual content of this document does not matter). Then open the `.docx` file, and edit the styles.

```{r, word-template-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Find the styles of a specific document element.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/word-template-1.png', dpi = NA)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:word-template-1) shows that you can open the "Styles" window from the "HOME" tab in Word. When you move the cursor to a specific element in the document, an item in the styles list will be highlighted. If you want to modify the styles of this type of elements, you can click the dropdown menu on the highlighted item, and you will see a dialog box like Figure \@ref(fig:word-template-2).

```{r, word-template-2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Modify the styles of an element in a Word document.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/word-template-2.png', dpi = NA)
```

After you finish modifying the styles, you can save the document (with a filename that will not be accidentally overwritten), and use it as the template for future Word documents. When Pandoc renders a new Word document with a reference document (template), it will read the styles in the template and apply them to the new document.

## The two-way workflow between R Markdown and Word {#word-redoc}

While it is easy to generate a Word document from R Markdown, things can be particularly painful when someone else edits the Word document and you have to manually port the changes back to the original R Markdown document. Luckily, Noam Ross has provided a promising solution to this problem. The **redoc** package (https://github.com/noamross/redoc) allows you to generate a Word document, revise the Word document, and convert the revised Word document back to R Markdown. Please note that as of this writing (January 2020), the **redoc** package is still experimental and has not been published to CRAN yet. You need to install it with:

```r
remotes::install_github("noamross/redoc")
```

Once the package is installed, you may use the output format `redoc::redoc`:

```yaml
---
output: redoc::redoc
---
```

This output format generates a Word document that actually stores the original Rmd document, so the Word document can be converted back to Rmd. Text written with the CriticMarkup syntax (http://criticmarkup.com) will be converted to tracked changes in Word, e.g., `{++ important ++}` means you want to insert a word "important" in the text.

You can convert the Word document generated by `redoc::redoc` to Rmd via the function `redoc::dedoc()`, e.g., `redoc::dedoc("file.docx")` will generate `file.Rmd`. In this process, you can decide how to deal with tracked changes in Word via the `track_changes` argument, e.g., you may accept or reject changes, or convert tracked changes to CriticMarkup.

When editing the Word document, you are expected to edit the parts that are _not_ automatically generated by code chunks or inline R expressions in R Markdown. For example, you must not edit a table if it is automatically generated by `knitr::kable()` in a code chunk, because such changes will be lost when you convert Word to Rmd via `dedoc()`. To avoid accidentally editing the automatic results from code chunks, you may set the option `highlight_outputs` to `true` in the `redoc::redoc` format, which means the automatic output will be highlighted in Word (with a background color). You should tell your collaborator that they should not touch these highlighted parts in the Word document.

The **redoc** package is still very young, so the introduction here is intentionally brief. When in doubt, we recommend that you read its documentation on GitHub.

## Style individual elements {#word-officedown}

Due to the simplicity of Markdown, you can apply some global styles to the Word document (see Section \@ref(word-template)), but it is not straightforward to style individual elements, such as changing the color of a word, or centering a paragraph.

Continuing his effort on making it easier to work with Office documents in R, David Gohel started to develop the **officedown** package (https://github.com/davidgohel/officedown) in 2018, which aims to bring some **officer** (https://github.com/davidgohel/officer) features into R Markdown. As of this writing, this package has not been published on CRAN yet, and you need to install it from GitHub:

```r
remotes::install_github("davidgohel/officedown")
```

After the package is installed, you need to load it in your R Markdown document, e.g.,

````md
```{r, setup, include=FALSE}`r ''`
library(officedown)
```
````

The **officedown** package allows you to style specific elements for the Word output. It has provided two types of syntax, and you can choose to use either one:

1. You can call functions of this package in inline R expressions, e.g., `` `r knitr::inline_expr('chunk_styled_text("officedown is great", color = "red", bold = TRUE)')` ``.

1. Or you can write the text in special HTML comments, e.g., `<!---CHUNK_TEXT{str: "officedown is great", color: "red", bold: true}--->`.

The two ways are equivalent---the latter way essentially calls a corresponding function in **officedown**, e.g., when **officedown** detects the tag `CHUNK_TEXT` in the comment, it calls the function `chunk_styled_text()` with the parameters specified in the curly brackets in the comment. You may see the GitHub repository of **officedown** for the available tags and functions.

Other things you may do with **officedown** include:

- Insert page breaks.

- Assign style names to text.

- Put content in a multi-column layout.

- Change paragraph settings.

- Insert a table of contents.

- Embed another Word document in the current document.

- Change the orientation of a section (landscape or portrait).
